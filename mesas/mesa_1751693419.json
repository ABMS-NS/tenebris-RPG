  "nome": "SHREK Once upon a time there was a lovely  princess. But she had an enchantment  upon her of a fearful sort which could  only be broken by love's first kiss.  She was locked away in a castle guarded  by a terrible fire-breathing dragon.  Many brave knights had attempted to  free her from this dreadful prison,  but non prevailed. She waited in the  dragon's keep in the highest room of  the tallest tower for her true love  and true love's first kiss. (laughs)  Like that's ever gonna happen. What  a load of - (toilet flush)  Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his  day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go  after the ogre.  NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOME  MAN1 Think it's in there?  MAN2 All right. Let's get it!  MAN1 Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that  thing can do to you?  MAN3 Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's  bread.  Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.  SHREK Yes, well, actually, that would be a  giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse.  They'll make a suit from your freshly  peeled skin.  MEN No!  SHREK They'll shave your liver. Squeeze the  jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's  quite good on toast.  MAN1 Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya!  (waves the torch at Shrek.)  Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The  men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long  and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the  men are in the dark.  SHREK This is the part where you run away.  (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.)  And stay out! (looks down and picks  up a piece of paper. Reads.) \"Wanted.  Fairy tale creatures.\"(He sighs and  throws the paper over his shoulder.)   THE NEXT DAY  There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard  sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures  to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line  are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto  who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three  little pigs.  GUARD All right. This one's full. Take it  away! Move it along. Come on! Get up!   HEAD GUARD Next!  GUARD (taking the witch's broom) Give me that!  Your flying days are over. (breaks the  broom in half)  HEAD GUARD That's 20 pieces of silver for the witch.  Next!  GUARD Get up! Come on!  HEAD GUARD Twenty pieces.  LITTLE BEAR (crying) This cage is too small.  DONKEY Please, don't turn me in. I'll never  be stubborn again. I can change. Please!  Give me another chance!  OLD WOMAN Oh, shut up. (jerks his rope)  DONKEY Oh!  HEAD GUARD Next! What have you got?  GIPETTO This little wooden puppet.  PINOCCHIO I'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. (his  nose grows)  HEAD GUARD Five shillings for the possessed toy.  Take it away.  PINOCCHIO Father, please! Don't let them do this!  Help me!  Gipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up  to the table.  HEAD GUARD Next! What have you got?  OLD WOMAN Well, I've got a talking donkey.  HEAD GUARD Right. Well, that's good for ten shillings,  if you can prove it.  OLD WOMAN Oh, go ahead, little fella.  Donkey just looks up at her.  HEAD GUARD Well?  OLD WOMAN Oh, oh, he's just...he's just a little  nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox.  Talk, you boneheaded dolt...  HEAD GUARD That's it. I've heard enough. Guards!   OLD WOMAN No, no, he talks! He does. (pretends  to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to  talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing  you ever saw.  HEAD GUARD Get her out of my sight.  OLD WOMAN No, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk!  The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One  of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's  hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled  with fairy dust and he's able to fly.  DONKEY Hey! I can fly!  PETER PAN He can fly!  3 LITTLE PIGS He can fly!  HEAD GUARD He can talk!  DONKEY Ha, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm  a flying, talking donkey. You might  have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly  but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey  fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins  to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink  to the ground.)  He hits the ground with a thud.  HEAD GUARD Seize him! (Donkey takes of running.)  After him!  GUARDS He's getting away! Get him! This way!  Turn!  Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally.  Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared  for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He  quickly hides behind Shrek.  HEAD GUARD You there. Ogre!  SHREK Aye?  HEAD GUARD By the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized  to place you both under arrest and transport  you to a designated resettlement facility.   SHREK Oh, really? You and what army?  He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well  and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail  and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and  begins walking back to his cottage.  DONKEY Can I say something to you? Listen,  you was really, really, really somethin'  back here. Incredible!  SHREK Are you talkin' to...(he turns around  and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back  around and Donkey is right in front  of him.) Whoa!  DONKEY Yes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell  you that you that you was great back  here? Those guards! They thought they  was all of that. Then you showed up,  and bam! They was trippin' over themselves  like babes in the woods. That really  made me feel good to see that.  SHREK Oh, that's great. Really.  DONKEY Man, it's good to be free.  SHREK Now, why don't you go celebrate your  freedom with your own friends? Hmm?   DONKEY But, uh, I don't have any friends. And  I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey,  wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll  stick with you. You're mean, green,  fightin' machine. Together we'll scare  the spit out of anybody that crosses  us.  Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very  loudly.  DONKEY Oh, wow! That was really scary. If you  don't mind me sayin', if that don't  work, your breath certainly will get  the job done, 'cause you definitely  need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause  you breath stinks! You almost burned  the hair outta my nose, just like the  time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey  continues to talk, so Shrek removes  his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten  berries. I had strong gases leaking  out of my butt that day.  SHREK Why are you following me?  DONKEY I'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause  I'm all alone, There's no one here beside  me, My problems have all gone, There's  no one to deride me, But you gotta have  faith...  SHREK Stop singing! It's no wonder you don't  have any friends.  DONKEY Wow. Only a true friend would be that  cruelly honest.  SHREK Listen, little donkey. Take a look at  me. What am I?  DONKEY (looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really  tall?  SHREK No! I'm an ogre! You know. \"Grab your  torch and pitchforks.\" Doesn't that  bother you?  DONKEY Nope.  SHREK Really?  DONKEY Really, really.  SHREK Oh.  DONKEY Man, I like you. What's you name?  SHREK Uh, Shrek.  DONKEY Shrek? Well, you know what I like about  you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me  thing. I like that. I respect that,  Shrek. You all right. (They come over  a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.)  Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live  in place like that?  SHREK That would be my home.  DONKEY Oh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful.  You know you are quite a decorator.  It's amazing what you've done with such  a modest budget. I like that boulder.  That is a nice boulder. I guess you  don't entertain much, do you?  SHREK I like my privacy.  DONKEY You know, I do too. That's another thing  we have in common. Like I hate it when  you got somebody in your face. You've  trying to give them a hint, and they  won't leave. There's that awkward silence.  (awkward silence) Can I stay with you?   SHREK Uh, what?  DONKEY Can I stay with you, please?  SHREK (sarcastically) Of course!  DONKEY Really?  SHREK No.  DONKEY Please! I don't wanna go back there!  You don't know what it's like to be  considered a freak. (pause while he  looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do.  But that's why we gotta stick together.  You gotta let me stay! Please! Please!   SHREK Okay! Okay! But one night only.  DONKEY Ah! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage)   SHREK What are you...? (Donkey hops up onto  a chair.) No! No!  DONKEY This is gonna be fun! We can stay up  late, swappin' manly stories, and in  the mornin' I'm makin' waffles.  SHREK Oh!  DONKEY Where do, uh, I sleep?  SHREK (irritated) Outside!  DONKEY Oh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean,  I don't know you, and you don't know  me, so I guess outside is best, you  know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek  slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do  like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was  born outside. I'll just be sitting by  myself outside, I guess, you know. By  myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's  no one here beside me...  SHREK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT  Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights  a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a  noise. He stands up with a huff.  SHREK (to Donkey) I thought I told you to  stay outside.  DONKEY (from the window) I am outside.  There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that  made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns  and spots 3 blind mice on his table.  BLIND MOUSE1 Well, gents, it's a far cry from the  farm, but what choice do we have?   BLIND MOUSE2 It's not home, but it'll do just fine.   GORDO (bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed.   SHREK Got ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes  and lands on his shoulder.)  GORDO I found some cheese. (bites Shrek's  ear)  SHREK Ow!  GORDO Blah! Awful stuff.  BLIND MOUSE1 Is that you, Gordo?  GORDO How did you know?  SHREK Enough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are  you doing in my house? (He gets bumped  from behind and he drops the mice.)  Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves  with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no,  no, no. Dead broad off the table.   DWARF Where are we supposed to put her? The  bed's taken.  SHREK Huh?  Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain.  The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at  him.  BIG BAD WOLF What?  TIME LAPSE  Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging  him to the front door.  SHREK I live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm  a terrifying ogre! What do I have to  do get a little privacy? (He opens the  front door to throw the Wolf out and  he sees that all the collected Fairy  Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh,  no. No! No!  The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his  pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing  flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.   SHREK What are you doing in my swamp? (this  echoes and everyone falls silent.)   Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a  tent.  SHREK All right, get out of here. All of you,  move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya!  Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more  dwarves run inside the house) No, no!  No, no. Not there. Not there. (they  shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to  look at Donkey)  DONKEY Hey, don't look at me. I didn't invite  them.  PINOCCHIO Oh, gosh, no one invited us.  SHREK What?  PINOCCHIO We were forced to come here.  SHREK (flabbergasted) By who?  LITTLE PIG Lord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed  and he...signed an eviction notice.   SHREK (heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where  this Farquaad guy is?  Everyone looks around at each other but no one answers.  DONKEY Oh, I do. I know where he is.  SHREK Does anyone else know where to find  him? Anyone at all?  DONKEY Me! Me!  SHREK Anyone?  DONKEY Oh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know!  Me, me!  SHREK (sigh) Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy  tale things. Do not get comfortable.  Your welcome is officially worn out.  In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad  right now and get you all off my land  and back where you came from! (Pause.  Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey)  You! You're comin' with me.  DONKEY All right, that's what I like to hear,  man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart  friends, off on a whirlwind big-city  adventure. I love it!  DONKEY (singing) On the road again. Sing it  with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get  on the road again.  SHREK What did I say about singing?  DONKEY Can I whistle?  SHREK No.  DONKEY Can I hum it?  SHREK All right, hum it.  Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'.  DULOC - KITCHEN  A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He's continually  dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in.  FARQUAAD That's enough. He's ready to talk.   The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down  onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the  table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes  up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.   FARQUAAD (he picks up the Gingerbread Man's legs  and plays with them) Run, run, run,  as fast as you can. You can't catch  me. I'm the gingerbread man.  GINGERBREAD MAN You are a monster.  FARQUAAD I'm not the monster here. You are. You  and the rest of that fairy tale trash,  poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell  me! Where are the others?  GINGERBREAD MAN Eat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad's  eye.)  FARQUAAD I've tried to be fair to you creatures.  Now my patience has reached its end!  Tell me or I'll...(he makes as if to  pull off the Gingerbread Man's buttons)   GINGERBREAD MAN No, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop  buttons.  FARQUAAD All right then. Who's hiding them?   GINGERBREAD MAN Okay, I'll tell you. Do you know the  muffin man?  FARQUAAD The muffin man?  GINGERBREAD MAN The muffin man.  FARQUAAD Yes, I know the muffin man, who lives  on Drury Lane?  GINGERBREAD MAN Well, she's married to the muffin man.   FARQUAAD The muffin man?  GINGERBREAD MAN The muffin man!  FARQUAAD She's married to the muffin man.  The door opens and the Head Guard walks in.  HEAD GUARD My lord! We found it.  FARQUAAD Then what are you waiting for? Bring  it in.  More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet.  They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic  Mirror.  GINGERBREAD MAN (in awe) Ohhhh...  FARQUAAD Magic mirror...  GINGERBREAD MAN Don't tell him anything! (Farquaad picks  him up and dumps him into a trash can  with a lid.) No!  FARQUAAD Evening. Mirror, mirror on the wall.  Is this not the most perfect kingdom  of them all?  MIRROR Well, technically you're not a king.   FARQUAAD Uh, Thelonius. (Thelonius holds up a  hand mirror and smashes it with his  fist.) You were saying?  MIRROR What I mean is you're not a king yet.  But you can become one. All you have  to do is marry a princess.  FARQUAAD Go on.  MIRROR (chuckles nervously) So, just sit back  and relax, my lord, because it's time  for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes.  And here they are! Bachelorette number  one is a mentally abused shut-in from  a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi  and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies  include cooking and cleaning for her  two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella.  (shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette  number two is a cape-wearing girl from  the land of fancy. Although she lives  with seven other men, she's not easy.  Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and  find out what a live wire she is. Come  on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows  picture of Snow White) And last, but  certainly not last, bachelorette number  three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded  castle surrounded by hot boiling lava!  But don't let that cool you off. She's  a loaded pistol who likes pina colads  and getting caught in the rain. Yours  for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows  picture of Princess Fiona) So will it  be bachelorette number one, bachelorette  number two or bachelorette number three?   GUARDS Two! Two! Three! Three! Two! Two! Three!   FARQUAAD Three? One? Three?  THELONIUS Three! (holds up 2 fingers) Pick number  three, my lord!  FARQUAAD Okay, okay, uh, number three!  MIRROR Lord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess  Fiona.  FARQUAAD Princess Fiona. She's perfect. All I  have to do is just find someone who  can go...  MIRROR But I probably should mention the little  thing that happens at night.  FARQUAAD I'll do it.  MIRROR Yes, but after sunset...  FARQUAAD Silence! I will make this Princess Fiona  my queen, and DuLoc will finally have  the perfect king! Captain, assemble  your finest men. We're going to have  a tournament. (smiles evilly)  DuLoc Parking Lot - Lancelot Section  Shrek and Donkey come out of the field that is right by the parking  lot. The castle itself is about 40 stories high.  DONKEY But that's it. That's it right there.  That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it.   SHREK So, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle.   DONKEY Uh-huh. That's the place.  SHREK Do you think maybe he's compensating  for something? (He laughs, but then  groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke.  He continues walking through the parking  lot.)  DONKEY Hey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.  MAN Hurry, darling. We're late. Hurry.   SHREK Hey, you! (The attendant, who is wearing  a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad,  screams and begins running through the  rows of rope to get to the front gate  to get away from Shrek.) Wait a second.  Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just  - - I just - - (He sighs and then begins  walking straight through the rows. The  attendant runs into a wall and falls  down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then  continue on into DuLoc.)  DULOC  They look around but all is quiet.  SHREK It's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody?   DONKEY Hey, look at this!  Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box  marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors  open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin  to sing.  WOODEN PEOPLE Welcome to DuLoc such a perfect town   Here we have some rules  Let us lay them down  Don't make waves, stay in line  And we'll get along fine  DuLoc is perfect place  Please keep off of the grass  Shine your shoes, wipe your... face  DuLoc is, DuLoc is  DuLoc is perfect place.  Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek's picture.  DONKEY Wow! Let's do that again! (makes ready  to run over and pull the lever again)   SHREK (grabs Donkey's tail and holds him still)  No. No. No, no, no! No.  They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena.  FARQUAAD Brave knights. You are the best and  brightest in all the land. Today one  of you shall prove himself...  As Shrek and Donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena  Donkey is humming the DuLoc theme song.  SHREK All right. You're going the right way  for a smacked bottom.  DONKEY Sorry about that.  FARQUAAD That champion shall have the honor -  - no, no - - the privilege to go forth  and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona  from the fiery keep of the dragon. If  for any reason the winner is unsuccessful,  the first runner-up will take his place  and so on and so forth. Some of you  may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing  to make. (cheers) Let the tournament  begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is  that? It's hideous!  SHREK (turns to look at Donkey and then back  at Farquaad) Ah, that's not very nice.  It's just a donkey.  FARQUAAD Indeed. Knights, new plan! The one who  kills the ogre will be named champion!  Have it him!  MEN Get him!  SHREK Oh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps  into a table where there are mugs of  beer)  CROWD Go ahead! Get him!  SHREK (holds up a mug of beer) Can't we just  settle this over a pint?  CROWD Kill the beast!  SHREK No? All right then. (drinks the beer)  Come on!  He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel  of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the  other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides  past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped.  As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger  beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll.  Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much  fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice  to say that Shrek kicks butt.  DONKEY Hey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me!  Shrek comes over and bangs a man's head up against Donkeys. Shrek  gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd.  SHREK Yeah!  A man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time  and sees him.  WOMAN The chair! Give him the chair!  Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men  are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding  sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild.  SHREK Oh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you  very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try  the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)  The laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on  Shrek.  HEAD GUARD Shall I give the order, sir?  FARQUAAD No, I have a better idea. People of  DuLoc, I give you our champion!  SHREK What?  FARQUAAD Congratulations, ogre. You're won the  honor of embarking on a great and noble  quest.  SHREK Quest? I'm already in a quest, a quest  to get my swamp back.  FARQUAAD Your swamp?  SHREK Yeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those  fairy tale creatures!  FARQUAAD Indeed. All right, ogre. I'll make you  a deal. Go on this quest for me, and  I'll give you your swamp back.  SHREK Exactly the way it was?  FARQUAAD Down to the last slime-covered toadstool.   SHREK And the squatters?  FARQUAAD As good as gone.  SHREK What kind of quest?  Time Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field  heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion.  DONKEY Let me get this straight. You're gonna  go fight a dragon and rescue a princess  just so Farquaad will give you back  a swamp which you only don't have because  he filled it full of freaks in the first  place. Is that about right?  SHREK You know, maybe there's a good reason  donkeys shouldn't talk.  DONKEY I don't get it. Why don't you just pull  some of that ogre stuff on him? Throttle  him, lay siege to his fortress, grinds  his bones to make your bread, the whole  ogre trip.  SHREK Oh, I know what. Maybe I could have  decapitated an entire village and put  their heads on a pike, gotten a knife,  cut open their spleen and drink their  fluids. Does that sound good to you?   DONKEY Uh, no, not really, no.  SHREK For your information, there's a lot  more to ogres than people think.  DONKEY Example?  SHREK Example? Okay, um, ogres are like onions.  (he holds out his onion)  DONKEY (sniffs the onion) They stink?  SHREK Yes - - No!  DONKEY They make you cry?  SHREK No!  DONKEY You leave them in the sun, they get  all brown, start sproutin' little white  hairs.  SHREK No! Layers! Onions have layers. Ogres  have layers! Onions have layers. You  get it? We both have layers. (he heaves  a sigh and then walks off)  DONKEY (trailing after Shrek) Oh, you both  have layers. Oh. {Sniffs} You know,  not everybody likes onions. Cake! Everybody  loves cakes! Cakes have layers.  SHREK I don't care... what everyone likes.  Ogres are not like cakes.  DONKEY You know what else everybody likes?  Parfaits. Have you ever met a person,  you say, \"Let's get some parfait,\" they  say, \"Hell no, I don't like no parfait\"?  Parfaits are delicious.  SHREK No! You dense, irritating, miniature  beast of burden! Ogres are like onions!  And of story. Bye-bye. See ya later.   DONKEY Parfaits may be the most delicious thing  on the whole damn planet.  SHREK You know, I think I preferred your humming.   DONKEY Do you have a tissue or something? I'm  making a mess. Just the word parfait  make me start slobbering.  They head off. There is a montage of their journey. Walking through  a field at sunset. Sleeping beneath a bright moon. Shrek trying  to put the campfire out the next day and having a bit of a problem,  so Donkey pees on the fire to put it out.  DRAGON'S KEEP  Shrek and Donkey are walking up to the keep that's supposed to  house Princess Fiona. It appears to look like a giant volcano.   DONKEY (sniffs) Ohh! Shrek! Did you do that?  You gotta warn somebody before you just  crack one off. My mouth was open and  everything.  SHREK Believe me, Donkey, if it was me, you'd  be dead. (sniffs) It's brimstone. We  must be getting close.  DONKEY Yeah, right, brimstone. Don't be talking  about it's the brimstone. I know what  I smell. It wasn't no brimstone. It  didn't come off no stone neither.   They climb up the side of the volcano/keep and look down. There  is a small piece of rock right in the center and that is where  the castle is. It is surrounded by boiling lava. It looks very  foreboding.  SHREK Sure, it's big enough, but look at the  location. (laughs...then the laugh turns  into a groan)  DONKEY Uh, Shrek? Uh, remember when you said  ogres have layers?  SHREK Oh, aye.  DONKEY Well, I have a bit of a confession to  make. Donkeys don't have layers. We  wear our fear right out there on our  sleeves.  SHREK Wait a second. Donkeys don't have sleeves.   DONKEY You know what I mean.  SHREK You can't tell me you're afraid of heights.   DONKEY No, I'm just a little uncomfortable  about being on a rickety bridge over  a boiling like of lava!  SHREK Come on, Donkey. I'm right here beside  ya, okay? For emotional support., we'll  just tackle this thing together one  little baby step at a time.  DONKEY Really?  SHREK Really, really.  DONKEY Okay, that makes me feel so much better.   SHREK Just keep moving. And don't look down.   DONKEY Okay, don't look down. Don't look down.  Don't look down. Keep on moving. Don't  look down. (he steps through a rotting  board and ends up looking straight down  into the lava) Shrek! I'm lookin' down!  Oh, God, I can't do this! Just let me  off, please!  SHREK But you're already halfway.  DONKEY But I know that half is safe!  SHREK Okay, fine. I don't have time for this.  You go back.  DONKEY Shrek, no! Wait!  SHREK Just, Donkey - - Let's have a dance  then, shall me? (bounces and sways the  bridge)  DONKEY Don't do that!  SHREK Oh, I'm sorry. Do what? Oh, this? (bounces  the bridge again)  DONKEY Yes, that!  SHREK Yes? Yes, do it. Okay. (continues to  bounce and sway as he backs Donkey across  the bridge)  DONKEY No, Shrek! No! Stop it!  SHREK You said do it! I'm doin' it.  DONKEY I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. Shrek,  I'm gonna die. (steps onto solid ground)  Oh!  SHREK That'll do, Donkey. That'll do. (walks  towards the castle)  DONKEY Cool. So where is this fire-breathing  pain-in-the-neck anyway?  SHREK Inside, waiting for us to rescue her.  (chuckles)  DONKEY I was talkin' about the dragon, Shrek.   INSIDE THE CASTLE  DONKEY You afraid?  SHREK No.  DONKEY But...  SHREK Shh.  DONKEY Oh, good. Me neither. (sees a skeleton  and gasps) 'Cause there's nothin' wrong  with bein' afraid. Fear's a sensible  response to an unfamiliar situation.  Unfamiliar dangerous situation, I might  add. With a dragon that breathes fire  and eats knights and breathes fire,  it sure doesn't mean you're a coward  if you're a little scared. I sure as  heck ain't no coward. I know that.   SHREK Donkey, two things, okay? Shut ... up.  Now go over there and see if you can  find any stairs.  DONKEY Stairs? I thought we was lookin' for  the princess.  SHREK (putting on a helmet) The princess will  be up the stairs in the highest room  in the tallest tower.  DONKEY What makes you think she'll be there?   SHREK I read it in a book once. (walks off)   DONKEY Cool. You handle the dragon. I'll handle  the stairs. I'll find those stairs.  I'll whip their butt too. Those stairs  won't know which way they're goin'.  (walks off)  EMPTY ROOM  Donkey is still talking to himself as he looks around the room.   DONKEY I'm gonna take drastic steps. Kick it  to the curb. Don't mess with me. I'm  the stair master. I've mastered the  stairs. I wish I had a step right here.  I'd step all over it.  ELSEWHERE  Shrek spots a light in the tallest tower window.  SHREK Well, at least we know where the princess  is, but where's the...  DONKEY (os) Dragon!  Donkey gasps and takes off running as the dragon roars again.  Shrek manages to grab Donkey out of the way just as the dragon  breathes fire.  SHREK Donkey, look out! (he manages to get  a hold of the dragons tail and holds  on) Got ya!  The dragon gets irritated at this and flicks it's tail and Shrek  goes flying through the air and crashes through the roof of the  tallest tower. Fiona wakes up with a jerk and looks at him lying  on the floor.  DONKEY Oh! Aah! Aah!  Donkey get cornered as the Dragon knocks away all but a small  part of the bridge he's on.  DONKEY No. Oh, no, No! (the dragon roars) Oh,  what large teeth you have. (the dragon  growls) I mean white, sparkling teeth.  I know you probably hear this all time  from your food, but you must bleach,  'cause that is one dazzling smile you  got there. Do I detect a hint of minty  freshness? And you know what else? You're  - - You're a girl dragon! Oh, sure!  I mean, of course you're a girl dragon.  You're just reeking of feminine beauty.  (the dragon begins fluttering her eyes  at him) What's the matter with you?  You got something in your eye? Ohh.  Oh. Oh. Man, I'd really love to stay,  but you know, I'm, uh...(the dragon  blows a smoke ring in the shape of a  heart right at him, and he coughs) I'm  an asthmatic, and I don't know if it'd  work out if you're gonna blow smoke  rings. Shrek! (the dragon picks him  up with her teeth and carries him off)  No! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!  FIONA'S ROOM  Shrek groans as he gets up off the floor. His back is to Fiona  so she straightens her dress and lays back down on the bed. She  then quickly reaches over and gets the bouquet of flowers off  the side table. She then lays back down and appears to be asleep.  Shrek turns and goes over to her. He looks down at Fiona for  a moment and she puckers her lips. Shrek takes her by the shoulders  and shakes her away.  FIONA Oh! Oh!  SHREK Wake up!  FIONA What?  SHREK Are you Princess Fiona?  FIONA I am, awaiting a knight so bold as to  rescue me.  SHREK Oh, that's nice. Now let's go!  FIONA But wait, Sir Knight. This be-ith our  first meeting. Should it not be a wonderful,  romantic moment?  SHREK Yeah, sorry, lady. There's no time.   FIONA Hey, wait. What are you doing? You should  sweep me off my feet out yonder window  and down a rope onto your valiant steed.   SHREK You've had a lot of time to plan this,  haven't you?  FIONA (smiles) Mm-hmm.  Shrek breaks the lock on her door and pulls her out and down  the hallway.  FIONA But we have to savor this moment! You  could recite an epic poem for me. A  ballad? A sonnet! A limerick? Or something!   SHREK I don't think so.  FIONA Can I at least know the name of my champion?   SHREK Uh, Shrek.  FIONA Sir Shrek. (clears throat and holds  out a handkerchief) I pray that you  take this favor as a token of my gratitude.   SHREK Thanks!  Suddenly they hear the dragon roar.  FIONA (surprised)You didn't slay the dragon?   SHREK It's on my to-do list. Now come on!  (takes off running and drags Fiona behind  him.)  FIONA But this isn't right! You were meant  to charge in, sword drawn, banner flying.  That's what all the other knights did.   SHREK Yeah, right before they burst into flame.   FIONA That's not the point. (Shrek suddenly  stops and she runs into him.) Oh! (Shrek  ignores her and heads for a wooden door  off to the side.) Wait. Where are you  going? The exit's over there.  SHREK Well, I have to save my ass.  FIONA What kind of knight are you?  SHREK One of a kind. (opens the door into  the throne room)  DONKEY (os) Slow down. Slow down, baby, please.  I believe it's healthy to get to know  someone over a long period of time.  Just call me old-fashioned. (laughs  worriedly) (we see him up close and  from a distance as Shrek sneaks into  the room) I don't want to rush into  a physical relationship. I'm not emotionally  ready for a commitment of, uh, this  - - Magnitude really is the word I'm  looking for. Magnitude- - Hey, that  is unwanted physical contact. Hey, what  are you doing? Okay, okay. Let's just  back up a little and take this one step  at a time. We really should get to know  each other first as friends or pen pals.  I'm on the road a lot, but I just love  receiving cards - - I'd really love  to stay, but - - Don't do that! That's  my tail! That's my personal tail. You're  gonna tear it off. I don't give permission  - - What are you gonna do with that?  Hey, now. No way. No! No! No, no! No.  No, no, no. No! Oh!  Shrek grabs a chain that's connected to the chandelier and swings  toward the dragon. He misses and he swings back again. He looks  up and spots that the chandelier is right above the dragons head.  He pulls on the chain and it releases and he falls down and bumps  Donkey out of the way right as the dragon is about to kiss him.  Instead the dragon kisses Shreks' butt. She opens her eyes and  roars. Shrek lets go of the chain and the chandelier falls onto  her head, but it's too big and it goes over her head and forms  a sort of collar for her. She roars again and Shrek and Donkey  take off running. Very 'Matrix' style. Shrek grabs Donkey and  then grabs Princess Fiona as he runs past her.  DONKEY Hi, Princess!  FIONA It talks!  SHREK Yeah, it's getting him to shut up that's  the trick.  They all start screaming as the dragon gains on them. Shrek spots  a descending slide and jumps on. But unfortunately there is a  crack in the stone and it hits Shrek right in the groin. His  eyes cross and as he reaches the bottom of the slide he stumbles  off and walks lightly.  SHREK Oh!  Shrek gets them close to the exit and sets down Donkey and Fiona.   SHREK Okay, you two, heard for the exit! I'll  take care of the dragon.  Shrek grabs a sword and heads back toward the interior of the  castle. He throws the sword down in between several overlapping  chain links. The chain links are attached to the chandelier that  is still around the dragons neck.  SHREK (echoing) Run!  They all take off running for the exit with the dragon in hot  pursuit. They make it to the bridge and head across. The dragons  breathes fire and the bridge begins to burn. They all hang on  for dear life as the ropes holding the bridge up collapse. They  are swung to the other side. As they hang upside down they look  in horror as the dragon makes to fly over the boiling lava to  get them. But suddenly the chandelier with the chain jerk the  dragon back and she's unable to get to them. Our gang climbs  quickly to safety as the dragon looks angry and then gives a  sad whimper as she watches Donkey walk away.  FIONA (sliding down the 'volcano' hill) You  did it! You rescued me! You're amazing.  (behind her Donkey falls down the hill)  You're - - You're wonderful. You're...  (turns and sees Shrek fall down the  hill and bump into Donkey) a little  unorthodox I'll admit. But thy deed  is great, and thy heart is pure. I am  eternally in your debt. (Donkey clears  his throat.) And where would a brave  knight be without his noble steed?   DONKEY I hope you heard that. She called me  a noble steed. She think I'm a steed.   FIONA The battle is won. You may remove your  helmet, good Sir Knight.  SHREK Uh, no.  FIONA Why not?  SHREK I have helmet hair.  FIONA Please. I would'st look upon the face  of my rescuer.  SHREK No, no, you wouldn't - - 'st.  FIONA But how will you kiss me?  SHREK What? (to Donkey) That wasn't in the  job description.  DONKEY Maybe it's a perk.  FIONA No, it's destiny. Oh, you must know  how it goes. A princess locked in a  tower and beset by a dragon is rescued  by a brave knight, and then they share  true love's first kiss.  DONKEY Hmm? With Shrek? You think- - Wait.  Wait. You think that Shrek is you true  love?  FIONA Well, yes.  Both Donkey and Shrek burst out laughing.  DONKEY You think Shrek is your true love!   FIONA What is so funny?  SHREK Let's just say I'm not your type, okay?Fiona:  Of course, you are. You're my rescuer.  Now - - Now remove your helmet.  SHREK Look. I really don't think this is a  good idea.  FIONA Just take off the helmet.  SHREK I'm not going to.  FIONA Take it off.  SHREK No!  FIONA Now!  SHREK Okay! Easy. As you command. Your Highness.  (takes off his helmet)  FIONA You- - You're a- - an ogre.  SHREK Oh, you were expecting Prince Charming.   FIONA Well, yes, actually. Oh, no. This is  all wrong. You're not supposed to be  an ogre.  SHREK Princess, I was sent to rescue you by  Lord Farquaad, okay? He is the one who  wants to marry you.  FIONA Then why didn't he come rescue me?   SHREK Good question. You should ask him that  when we get there.  FIONA But I have to be rescued by my true  love, not by some ogre and his- - his  pet.  DONKEY Well, so much for noble steed.  SHREK You're not making my job any easier.   FIONA I'm sorry, but your job is not my problem.  You can tell Lord Farquaad that if he  wants to rescue me properly, I'll be  waiting for him right here.  SHREK Hey! I'm no one's messenger boy, all  right? (ominous) I'm a delivery boy.  (he swiftly picks her up and swings  her over his shoulder like she was a  sack of potatoes)  FIONA You wouldn't dare. Put me down!  SHREK Ya comin', Donkey?  DONKEY I'm right behind ya.  FIONA Put me down, or you will suffer the  consequences! This is not dignified!  Put me down!  WOODS  A little time has passed and Fiona has calmed down. She just  hangs there limply while Shrek carries her.  DONKEY Okay, so here's another question. Say  there's a woman that digs you, right,  but you don't really like her that way.  How do you let her down real easy so  her feelings aren't hurt, but you don't  get burned to a crisp and eaten?  FIONA You just tell her she's not your true  love. Everyone knows what happens when  you find your...(Shrek drops her on  the ground) Hey! The sooner we get to  DuLoc the better.  DONKEY You're gonna love it there, Princess.  It's beautiful!  FIONA And what of my groom-to-be? Lord Farquaad?  What's he like?  SHREK Let me put it this way, Princess. Men  of Farquaad's stature are in short supply.  (he and Donkey laugh)  Shrek then proceeds to splash water onto his face to wash off  the dust and grime.  DONKEY I don't know. There are those who think  little of him. (they laugh again) Fiona:  Stop it. Stop it, both of you. You're  just jealous you can never measure up  to a great ruler like Lord Farquaad.   SHREK Yeah, well, maybe you're right, Princess.  But I'll let you do the \"measuring\"  when you see him tomorrow.  FIONA (looks at the setting sun) Tomorrow?  It'll take that long? Shouldn't we stop  to make camp?  SHREK No, that'll take longer. We can keep  going.  FIONA But there's robbers in the woods.  DONKEY Whoa! Time out, Shrek! Camp is starting  to sound good.  SHREK Hey, come on. I'm scarier than anything  we're going to see in this forest.   FIONA I need to find somewhere to camp now!   Both Donkey and Shrek's ears lower as they shrink away from her.   MOUNTAIN CLIFF  Shrek has found a cave that appears to be in good order. He shoves  a stone boulder out of the way to reveal the cave.  SHREK Hey! Over here.  DONKEY Shrek, we can do better than that. I  don't think this is fit for a princess.   FIONA No, no, it's perfect. It just needs  a few homey touches.  SHREK Homey touches? Like what? (he hears  a tearing noise and looks over at Fiona  who has torn the bark off of a tree.)   FIONA A door? Well, gentlemen, I bid thee  good night. (goes into the cave and  puts the bark door up behind her)   DONKEY You want me to read you a bedtime story?  I will.  FIONA (os) I said good night!  Shrek looks at Donkey for a second and then goes to move the  boulder back in front of the entrance to the cave with Fiona  still inside.  DONKEY Shrek, What are you doing?  SHREK (laughs) I just- - You know - - Oh,  come on. I was just kidding.  LATER THAT NIGHT  Shrek and Donkey are sitting around a campfire. They are staring  up into the sky as Shrek points out certain star constellations  to Donkey.  SHREK And, uh, that one, that's Throwback,  the only ogre to ever spit over three  wheat fields.  DONKEY Right. Yeah. Hey, can you tell my future  from these stars?  SHREK The stars don't tell the future, Donkey.  They tell stories. Look, there's Bloodnut,  the Flatulent. You can guess what he's  famous for.  DONKEY I know you're making this up.  SHREK No, look. There he is, and there's the  group of hunters running away from his  stench.  DONKEY That ain't nothin' but a bunch of little  dots.  SHREK You know, Donkey, sometimes things are  more than they appear. Hmm? Forget it.   DONKEY (heaves a big sigh) Hey, Shrek, what  we gonna do when we get our swamp anyway?   SHREK Our swamp?  DONKEY You know, when we're through rescuing  the princess.  SHREK We? Donkey, there's no \"we\". There's  no \"our\". There's just me and my swamp.  The first thing I'm gonna do is build  a ten-foot wall around my land.  DONKEY You cut me deep, Shrek. You cut me real  deep just now. You know what I think?  I think this whole wall thing is just  a way to keep somebody out.  SHREK No, do ya think?  DONKEY Are you hidin' something?  SHREK Never mind, Donkey.  DONKEY Oh, this is another one of those onion  things, isn't it?  SHREK No, this is one of those drop-it and  leave-it alone things.  DONKEY Why don't you want to talk about it?   SHREK Why do you want to talk about it?  DONKEY Why are you blocking?  SHREK I'm not blocking.  DONKEY Oh, yes, you are.  SHREK Donkey, I'm warning you.  DONKEY Who you trying to keep out?  SHREK Everyone! Okay?  DONKEY (pause) Oh, now we're gettin' somewhere.  (grins)  At this point Fiona pulls the 'door' away from the entrance to  the cave and peaks out. Neither of the guys see her.  SHREK Oh! For the love of Pete! (gets up and  walks over to the edge of the cliff  and sits down)  DONKEY What's your problem? What you got against  the whole world anyway?  SHREK Look, I'm not the one with the problem,  okay? It's the world that seems to have  a problem with me. People take one look  at me and go. \"Aah! Help! Run! A big,  stupid, ugly ogre!\" They judge me before  they even know me. That's why I'm better  off alone.  DONKEY You know what? When we met, I didn't  think you was just a big, stupid, ugly  ogre.  SHREK Yeah, I know.  DONKEY So, uh, are there any donkeys up there?   SHREK Well, there's, um, Gabby, the Small  and Annoying.  DONKEY Okay, okay, I see it now. The big shiny  one, right there. That one there?   Fiona puts the door back.  SHREK That's the moon.  DONKEY Oh, okay.  DuLoc - Farquaad's Bedroom  The camera pans over a lot of wedding stuff. Soft music plays  in the background. Farquaad is in bed, watching as the Magic  Mirror shows him Princess Fiona.  FARQUAAD Again, show me again. Mirror, mirror,  show her to me. Show me the princess.   MIRROR Hmph.  The Mirror rewinds and begins to play again from the beginning.   FARQUAAD Ah. Perfect.  Farquaad looks down at his bare chest and pulls the sheet up  to cover himself as though Fiona could see him as he gazes sheepishly  at her image in the mirror.  MORNING  Fiona walks out of the cave. She glances at Shrek and Donkey  who are still sleeping. She wanders off into the woods and comes  across a blue bird. She begins to sing. The bird sings along  with her. She hits higher and higher notes and the bird struggles  to keep up with her. Suddenly the pressure of the note is too  big and the bird explodes. Fiona looks a little sheepish, but  she eyes the eggs that the bird left behind. Time lapse, Fiona  is now cooking the eggs for breakfast. Shrek and Donkey are still  sleeping. Shrek wakes up and looks at Fiona. Donkey's talking  in his sleep.  DONKEY (quietly) Mmm, yeah, you know I like  it like that. Come on, baby. I said  I like it.  SHREK Donkey, wake up. (shakes him)  DONKEY Huh? What?  SHREK Wake up.  DONKEY What? (stretches and yawns)  FIONA Good morning. Hm, how do you like your  eggs?  DONKEY Oh, good morning, Princess!  Fiona gets up and sets the eggs down in front of them.  SHREK What's all this about?  FIONA You know, we kind of got off to a bad  start yesterday. I wanted to make it  up to you. I mean, after all, you did  rescue me.  SHREK Uh, thanks.  Donkey sniffs the eggs and licks his lips.  FIONA Well, eat up. We've got a big day ahead  of us. (walks off)  LATER  They are once again on their way. They are walking through the  forest. Shrek belches.  DONKEY Shrek!  SHREK What? It's a compliment. Better out  than in, I always say. (laughs)  DONKEY Well, it's no way to behave in front  of a princess.  Fiona belches  FIONA Thanks.  DONKEY She's as nasty as you are.  SHREK (chuckles) You know, you're not exactly  what I expected.  FIONA Well, maybe you shouldn't judge people  before you get to know them.  She smiles and then continues walking, singing softly. Suddenly  from out of nowhere, a man swings down and swoops Fiona up into  a tree.  ROBIN HOOD La liberte! Hey!  SHREK Princess!  FIONA (to Robin Hood) What are you doing?   ROBIN HOOD Be still, mon cherie, for I am you savior!  And I am rescuing you from this green...(kisses  up her arm while Fiona pulls back in  disgust)...beast.  SHREK Hey! That's my princess! Go find you  own!  ROBIN HOOD Please, monster! Can't you see I'm a  little busy here?  FIONA (getting fed up) Look, pal, I don't  know who you think you are!  ROBIN HOOD Oh! Of course! Oh, how rude. Please  let me introduce myself. Oh, Merry Men.  (laughs)  Suddenly an accordion begins to play and the Merry men pop out  from the bushes. They begin to sing Robin's theme song.  MERRY MEN Ta, dah, dah, dah, whoo.  ROBIN HOOD I steal from the rich and give to the  needy.  MERRY MEN He takes a wee percentage,  ROBIN HOOD But I'm not greedy. I rescue pretty  damsels, man, I'm good.  MERRY MEN What a guy, Monsieur Hood.  ROBIN HOOD Break it down. I like an honest fight  and a saucy little maid...  MERRY MEN What he's basically saying is he likes  to get...  ROBIN HOOD Paid. So...When an ogre in the bush  grabs a lady by the tush. That's bad.   MERRY MEN That's bad.  ROBIN HOOD When a beauty's with a beast it makes  me awfully mad.  MERRY MEN He's mad, he's really, really mad.   ROBIN HOOD I'll take my blade and ram it through  your heart, keep your eyes on me, boys  'cause I'm about to start...  There is a grunt as Fiona swings down from the tree limb and  knocks Robin Hood unconscious.  FIONA Man, that was annoying!  Shrek looks at her in admiration.  MERRY MAN Oh, you little- - (shoots an arrow at  Fiona but she ducks out of the way)   The arrow flies toward Donkey who jumps into Shrek's arms to  get out of the way. The arrow proceeds to just bounce off a tree.   Another fight sequence begins and Fiona gives a karate yell and  then proceeds to beat the crap out of the Merry Men. There is  a very interesting 'Matrix' moment here when Fiona pauses in  mid-air to fix her hair. Finally all of the Merry Men are down,  and Fiona begins walking away.  FIONA Uh, shall we?  SHREK Hold the phone. (drops Donkey and begins  walking after Fiona) Oh! Whoa, whoa,  whoa. Hold on now. Where did that come  from?  FIONA What?  SHREK That! Back there. That was amazing!  Where did you learn that?  FIONA Well...(laughs) when one lives alone,  uh, one has to learn these things in  case there's a...(gasps and points)  there's an arrow in your butt!  SHREK What? (turns and looks) Oh, would you  look at that? (he goes to pull it out  but flinches because it's tender)   FIONA Oh, no. This is all my fault. I'm so  sorry.  DONKEY (walking up) Why? What's wrong?  FIONA Shrek's hurt.  DONKEY Shrek's hurt. Shrek's hurt? Oh, no,  Shrek's gonna die.  SHREK Donkey, I'm okay.  DONKEY You can't do this to me, Shrek. I'm  too young for you to die. Keep you legs  elevated. Turn your head and cough.  Does anyone know the Heimlich?  FIONA Donkey! Calm down. If you want to help  Shrek, run into the woods and find me  a blue flower with red thorns.  DONKEY Blue flower, red thorns. Okay, I'm on  it. Blue flower, red thorns. Don't die  Shrek. If you see a long tunnel, stay  away from the light!  SHREK & FIONA Donkey!  DONKEY Oh, yeah. Right. Blue flower, red thorns.  (runs off)  SHREK What are the flowers for?  FIONA (like it's obvious) For getting rid  of Donkey.  SHREK Ah.  FIONA Now you hold still, and I'll yank this  thing out. (gives the arrow a little  pull)  SHREK (jumps away) Ow! Hey! Easy with the  yankin'.  As they continue to talk Fiona keeps going after the arrow and  Shrek keeps dodging her hands.  FIONA I'm sorry, but it has to come out.   SHREK No, it's tender.  FIONA Now, hold on.  SHREK What you're doing is the opposite of  help.  FIONA Don't move.  SHREK Look, time out.  FIONA Would you...(grunts as Shrek puts his  hand over her face to stop her from  getting at the arrow) Okay. What do  you propose we do?  ELSEWHERE  Donkey is still looking for the special flower.  DONKEY Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower,  red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns.  This would be so much easier if I wasn't  color-blind! Blue flower, red thorns.   SHREK (os) Ow!  DONKEY Hold on, Shrek! I'm comin'! (rips a  flower off a nearby bush that just happens  to be a blue flower with red thorns)   THE FOREST PATH  SHREK Ow! Not good.  FIONA Okay. Okay. I can nearly see the head.  (Shrek grunts as she pulls) It's just  about...  SHREK Ow! Ohh! (he jerks and manages to fall  over with Fiona on top of him)  DONKEY Ahem.  SHREK (throwing Fiona off of him) Nothing  happend. We were just, uh - -  DONKEY Look, if you wanted to be alone, all  you had to do was ask. Okay?  SHREK Oh, come on! That's the last thing on  my mind. The princess here was just-  - (Fiona pulls the arrow out) Ugh! (he  turns to look at Fiona who holds up  the arrow with a smile) Ow!  DONKEY Hey, what's that? (nervous chuckle)  That's...is that blood?  Donkey faints. Shrek walks over and picks him up as they continue  on their way.  There is a montage of scenes as the group heads back to DuLoc.  Shrek crawling up to the top of a tree to make it fall over a  small brook so that Fiona won't get wet. Shrek then gets up as  Donkey is just about to cross the tree and the tree swings back  into it's upright position and Donkey flies off. Shrek swatting  and a bunch of flies and mosquitoes. Fiona grabs a nearby spiderweb  that's on a tree branch and runs through the field swinging it  around to catch the bugs. She then hands it to Shrek who begins  eating like it's a treat. As he walks off she licks her fingers.  Shrek catching a toad and blowing it up like a balloon and presenting  it to Fiona. Fiona catching a snake, blowing it up, fashioning  it into a balloon animal and presenting it to Shrek. The group  arriving at a windmill that is near DuLoc.  WINDMILL  SHREK There it is, Princess. Your future awaits  you.  FIONA That's DuLoc?  DONKEY Yeah, I know. You know, Shrek thinks  Lord Farquaad's compensating for something,  which I think means he has a really...(Shrek  steps on his hoof) Ow!  SHREK Um, I, uh- - I guess we better move  on.  FIONA Sure. But, Shrek? I'm - - I'm worried  about Donkey.  SHREK What?  FIONA I mean, look at him. He doesn't look  so good.  DONKEY What are you talking about? I'm fine.   FIONA (kneels to look him in the eyes) That's  what they always say, and then next  thing you know, you're on your back.  (pause) Dead.  SHREK You know, she's right. You look awful.  Do you want to sit down?  FIONA Uh, you know, I'll make you some tea.   DONKEY I didn't want to say nothin', but I  got this twinge in my neck, and when  I turn my head like this, look, (turns  his neck in a very sharp way until his  head is completely sideways) Ow! See?   SHREK Who's hungry? I'll find us some dinner.   FIONA I'll get the firewood.  DONKEY Hey, where you goin'? Oh, man, I can't  feel my toes! (looks down and yelps)  I don't have any toes! I think I need  a hug.  SUNSET  Shrek has built a fire and is cooking the rest of dinner while  Fiona eats.  FIONA Mmm. This is good. This is really good.  What is this?  SHREK Uh, weed rat. Rotisserie style.  FIONA No kidding. Well, this is delicious.   SHREK Well, they're also great in stews. Now,  I don't mean to brag, but I make a mean  weed rat stew. (chuckles)  Fiona looks at DuLoc and sighs.  FIONA I guess I'll be dining a little differently  tomorrow night.  SHREK Maybe you can come visit me in the swamp  sometime. I'll cook all kind of stuff  for you. Swamp toad soup, fish eye tartare  - - you name it.  FIONA (smiles) I'd like that.  They smiles at each other.  SHREK Um, Princess?  FIONA Yes, Shrek?  SHREK I, um, I was wondering...are you...(sighs)  Are you gonna eat that?  DONKEY (chuckles) Man, isn't this romantic?  Just look at that sunset.  FIONA (jumps up) Sunset? Oh, no! I mean, it's  late. I-It's very late.  SHREK What?  DONKEY Wait a minute. I see what's goin' on  here. You're afraid of the dark, aren't  you?  FIONA Yes! Yes, that's it. I'm terrified.  You know, I'd better go inside.  DONKEY Don't feel bad, Princess. I used to  be afraid of the dark, too, until -  - Hey, no, wait. I'm still afraid of  the dark.  Shrek sighs  FIONA Good night.  SHREK Good night.  Fiona goes inside the windmill and closes the door. Donkey looks  at Shrek with a new eye.  DONKEY Ohh! Now I really see what's goin' on  here.  SHREK Oh, what are you talkin' about?  DONKEY I don't even wanna hear it. Look, I'm  an animal, and I got instincts. And  I know you two were diggin' on each  other. I could feel it.  SHREK You're crazy. I'm just bringing her  back to Farquaad.  DONKEY Oh, come on, Shrek. Wake up and smell  the pheromones. Just go on in and tell  her how you feel.  SHREK I- - There's nothing to tell. Besides,  even if I did tell her that, well, you  know - - and I'm not sayin' I do 'cause  I don't - - she's a princess, and I'm  - -  DONKEY An ogre?  SHREK Yeah. An ogre.  DONKEY Hey, where you goin'?  SHREK To get... move firewood. (sighs)  Donkey looks over at the large pile of firewood there already  is.  TIME LAPSE  Donkey opens the door to the Windmill and walks in. Fiona is  nowhere to be seen.  DONKEY Princess? Princess Fiona? Princess,  where are you? Princess?  Fiona looks at Donkey from the shadows, but we can't see her.   DONKEY It's very spooky in here. I ain't playing  no games.  Suddenly Fiona falls from the railing. She gets up only she doesn't  look like herself. She looks like an ogre and Donkey starts freaking  out.  DONKEY Aah!  FIONA Oh, no!  DONKEY No, help!  FIONA Shh!  DONKEY Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!  FIONA No, it's okay. It's okay.  DONKEY What did you do with the princess?   FIONA Donkey, I'm the princess.  DONKEY Aah!  FIONA It's me, in this body.  DONKEY Oh, my God! You ate the princess. (to  her stomach) Can you hear me?  FIONA Donkey!  DONKEY (still aimed at her stomach) Listen,  keep breathing! I'll get you out of  there!  FIONA No!  DONKEY Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!  FIONA Shh.  DONKEY Shrek!  FIONA This is me.  Donkey looks into her eyes as she pets his muzzle, and he quiets  down.  DONKEY Princess? What happened to you? You're,  uh, uh, uh, different.  FIONA I'm ugly, okay?  DONKEY Well, yeah! Was it something you ate?  'Cause I told Shrek those rats was a  bad idea. You are what you eat, I said.  Now - -  FIONA No. I - - I've been this way as long  as I can remember.  DONKEY What do you mean? Look, I ain't never  seen you like this before.  FIONA It only happens when sun goes down.  \"By night one way, by day another. This  shall be the norm... until you find  true love's first kiss... and then take  love's true form.\"  DONKEY Ah, that's beautiful. I didn't know  you wrote poetry.  FIONA It's a spell. (sigh) When I was a little  girl, a witch cast a spell on me. Every  night I become this. This horrible,  ugly beast! I was placed in a tower  to await the day my true love would  rescue me. That's why I have to marry  Lord Farquaad tomorrow before the sun  sets and he sees me like this. (begins  to cry)  DONKEY All right, all right. Calm down. Look,  it's not that bad. You're not that ugly.  Well, I ain't gonna lie. You are ugly.  But you only look like this at night.  Shrek's ugly 24-7.  FIONA But Donkey, I'm a princess, and this  is not how a princess is meant to look.   DONKEY Princess, how 'bout if you don't marry  Farquaad?  FIONA I have to. Only my true love's kiss  can break the spell.  DONKEY But, you know, um, you're kind of an  orge, and Shrek - - well, you got a  lot in common.  FIONA Shrek?  OUTSIDE  Shrek is walking towards the windmill with a sunflower in his  hand.  SHREK (to himself) Princess, I - - Uh, how's  it going, first of all? Good? Um, good  for me too. I'm okay. I saw this flower  and thought of you because it's pretty  and - - well, I don't really like it,  but I thought you might like it 'cause  you're pretty. But I like you anyway.  I'd - - uh, uh...(sighs) I'm in trouble.  Okay, here we go.  He walks up to the door and pauses outside when he hears Donkey  and Fiona talking.  FIONA (os) I can't just marry whoever I want.  Take a good look at me, Donkey. I mean,  really, who can ever love a beast so  hideous and ugly? \"Princess\" and \"ugly\"  don't go together. That's why I can't  stay here with Shrek.  Shrek steps back in shock.  FIONA (os) My only chance to live happily  ever after is to marry my true love.   Shrek heaves a deep sigh. He throws the flower down and walks  away.  INSIDE  FIONA Don't you see, Donkey? That's just how  it has to be. It's the only way to break  the spell.  DONKEY You at least gotta tell Shrek the truth.   FIONA No! You can't breathe a word. No one  must ever know.  DONKEY What's the point of being able to talk  if you gotta keep secrets?  FIONA Promise you won't tell. Promise!  DONKEY All right, all right. I won't tell him.  But you should. (goes outside) I just  know before this is over, I'm gonna  need a whole lot of serious therapy.  Look at my eye twitchin'.  Fiona comes out the door and watches him walk away. She looks  down and spots the sunflower. She picks it up before going back  inside the windmill.  MORNING  Donkey is asleep. Shrek is nowhere to be seen. Fiona is still  awake. She is plucking petals from the sunflower.  FIONA I tell him, I tell him not. I tell him,  I tell him not. I tell him. (she quickly  runs to the door and goes outside) Shrek!  Shrek, there's something I want...(she  looks and sees the rising sun, and as  the sun crests the sky she turns back  into a human.)  Just as she looks back at the sun she sees Shrek stomping towards  her.  FIONA Shrek. Are you all right?  SHREK Perfect! Never been better.  FIONA I - - I don't - - There's something  I have to tell you.  SHREK You don't have to tell me anything,  Princess. I heard enough last night.   FIONA You heard what I said?  SHREK Every word.  FIONA I thought you'd understand.  SHREK Oh, I understand. Like you said, \"Who  could love a hideous, ugly beast?\"   FIONA But I thought that wouldn't matter to  you.  SHREK Yeah? Well, it does. (Fiona looks at  him in shock. He looks past her and  spots a group approaching.) Ah, right  on time. Princess, I've brought you  a little something.  Farquaad has arrived with a group of his men. He looks very regal  sitting up on his horse. You would never guess that he's only  like 3 feet tall. Donkey wakes up with a yawn as the soldiers  march by.  DONKEY What'd I miss? What'd I miss? (spots  the soldiers) (muffled) Who said that?  Couldn't have been the donkey.  FARQUAAD Princess Fiona.  SHREK As promised. Now hand it over.  FARQUAAD Very well, ogre. (holds out a piece  of paper) The deed to your swamp, cleared  out, as agreed. Take it and go before  I change my mind. (Shrek takes the paper)  Forgive me, Princess, for startling  you, but you startled me, for I have  never seen such a radiant beauty before.  I'm Lord Farquaad.  FIONA Lord Farquaad? Oh, no, no. (Farquaad  snaps his fingers) Forgive me, my lord,  for I was just saying a short... (Watches  as Farquaad is lifted off his horse  and set down in front of her. He comes  to her waist.) farewell.  FARQUAAD Oh, that is so sweet. You don't have  to waste good manners on the ogre. It's  not like it has feelings.  FIONA No, you're right. It doesn't.  Donkey watches this exchange with a curious look on his face.   FARQUAAD Princess Fiona, beautiful, fair, flawless  Fiona. I ask your hand in marriage.  Will you be the perfect bride for the  perfect groom?  FIONA Lord Farquaad, I accept. Nothing would  make - -  FARQUAAD (interrupting) Excellent! I'll start  the plans, for tomorrow we wed!  FIONA No! I mean, uh, why wait? Let's get  married today before the sun sets.   FARQUAAD Oh, anxious, are you? You're right.  The sooner, the better. There's so much  to do! There's the caterer, the cake,  the band, the guest list. Captain, round  up some guests! (a guard puts Fiona  on the back of his horse)  FIONA Fare-thee-well, ogre.  Farquaad's whole party begins to head back to DuLoc. Donkey watches  them go.  DONKEY Shrek, what are you doing? You're letting  her get away.  SHREK Yeah? So what?  DONKEY Shrek, there's something about her you  don't know. Look, I talked to her last  night, She's - -  SHREK I know you talked to her last night.  You're great pals, aren't ya? Now, if  you two are such good friends, why don't  you follow her home?  DONKEY Shrek, I - - I wanna go with you.  SHREK I told you, didn't I? You're not coming  home with me. I live alone! My swamp!  Me! Nobody else! Understand? Nobody!  Especially useless, pathetic, annoying,  talking donkeys!  DONKEY But I thought - -  SHREK Yeah. You know what? You thought wrong!  (stomps off)  DONKEY Shrek.  Montage of different scenes. Shrek arriving back home. Fiona  being fitted for the wedding dress. Donkey at a stream running  into the dragon. Shrek cleaning up his house. Fiona eating dinner  alone. Shrek eating dinner alone.  SHREK'S HOME  Shrek is eating dinner when he hears a sound outside. He goes  outside to investigate.  SHREK Donkey? (Donkey ignores him and continues  with what he's doing.) What are you  doing?  DONKEY I would think, of all people, you would  recognize a wall when you see one.   SHREK Well, yeah. But the wall's supposed  to go around my swamp, not through it.   DONKEY It is around your half. See that's your  half, and this is my half.  SHREK Oh! Your half. Hmm.  DONKEY Yes, my half. I helped rescue the princess.  I did half the work. I get half the  booty. Now hand me that big old rock,  the one that looks like your head.   SHREK Back off!  DONKEY No, you back off.  SHREK This is my swamp!  DONKEY Our swamp.  SHREK (grabs the tree branch Donkey is working  with) Let go, Donkey!  DONKEY You let go.  SHREK Stubborn jackass!  DONKEY Smelly ogre.  SHREK Fine! (drops the tree branch and walks  away)  DONKEY Hey, hey, come back here. I'm not through  with you yet.  SHREK Well, I'm through with you.  DONKEY Uh-uh. You know, with you it's always,  \"Me, me, me!\" Well, guess what! Now  it's my turn! So you just shut up and  pay attention! You are mean to me. You  insult me and you don't appreciate anything  that I do! You're always pushing me  around or pushing me away.  SHREK Oh, yeah? Well, if I treated you so  bad, how come you came back?  DONKEY Because that's what friends do! They  forgive each other!  SHREK Oh, yeah. You're right, Donkey. I forgive  you... for stabbin' me in the back!  (goes into the outhouse and slams the  door)  DONKEY Ohh! You're so wrapped up in layers,  onion boy, you're afraid of your own  feelings.  SHREK (os) Go away!  DONKEY There you are , doing it again just  like you did to Fiona. All she ever  do was like you, maybe even love you.   SHREK (os) Love me? She said I was ugly, a  hideous creature. I heard the two of  you talking.  DONKEY She wasn't talkin' about you. She was  talkin' about, uh, somebody else.   SHREK (opens the door and comes out) She wasn't  talking about me? Well, then who was  she talking about?  DONKEY Uh-uh, no way. I ain't saying anything.  You don't wanna listen to me. Right?  Right?  SHREK Donkey!  DONKEY No!  SHREK Okay, look. I'm sorry, all right? (sigh)  I'm sorry. I guess I am just a big,  stupid, ugly ogre. Can you forgive me?   DONKEY Hey, that's what friends are for, right?   SHREK Right. Friends?  DONKEY Friends.  SHREK So, um, what did Fiona say about me?   DONKEY What are you asking me for? Why don't  you just go ask her?  SHREK The wedding! We'll never make it in  time.  DONKEY Ha-ha-ha! Never fear, for where, there's  a will, there's a way and I have a way.  (whistles)  Suddenly the dragon arrives overhead and flies low enough so  they can climb on.  SHREK Donkey?  DONKEY I guess it's just my animal magnetism.   They both laugh.  SHREK Aw, come here, you. (gives Donkey a  noogie)  DONKEY All right, all right. Don't get all  slobbery. No one likes a kiss ass. All  right, hop on and hold on tight. I haven't  had a chance to install the seat belts  yet.  They climb aboard the dragon and she takes off for DuLoc.  DULOC - CHURCH  Fiona and Farquaad are getting married. The whole town is there.  The prompter card guy holds up a card that says 'Revered Silence'.   PRIEST People of DuLoc, we gather here today  to bear witness to the union....  FIONA (eyeing the setting sun) Um-  PRIEST ...of our new king...  FIONA Excuse me. Could we just skip ahead  to the \"I do's\"?  FARQUAAD (chuckles and then motions to the priest  to indulge Fiona) Go on.  COURTYARD  Some guards are milling around. Suddenly the dragon lands with  a boom. The guards all take off running.  DONKEY (to Dragon) Go ahead, HAVE SOME FUN.  If we need you, I'll whistle. How about  that? (she nods and goes after the guards)  Shrek, wait, wait! Wait a minute! You  wanna do this right, don't you?  SHREK (at the Church door) What are you talking  about?  DONKEY There's a line you gotta wait for. The  preacher's gonna say, \"Speak now or  forever hold your peace.\" That's when  you say, \"I object!\"  SHREK I don't have time for this!  DONKEY Hey, wait. What are you doing? Listen  to me! Look, you love this woman, don't  you?  SHREK Yes.  DONKEY You wanna hold her?  SHREK Yes.  DONKEY Please her?  SHREK Yes!  DONKEY (singing James Brown style) Then you  got to, got to try a little tenderness.  (normal) The chicks love that romantic  crap!  SHREK All right! Cut it out. When does this  guy say the line?  DONKEY We gotta check it out.  INSIDE CHURCH  As the priest talks we see Donkey's shadow through one of the  windows Shrek tosses him up so he can see.  PRIEST And so, by the power vested in me...   Outside  SHREK What do you see?  DONKEY The whole town's in there.  Inside  PRIEST I now pronounce you husband and wife...   Outside  DONKEY They're at the altar.  Inside  PRIEST ...king and queen.  Outside  DONKEY Mother Fletcher! He already said it.   SHREK Oh, for the love of Pete!  He runs inside without catching Donkey, who hits the ground hard.   INSIDE CHURCH  SHREK (running toward the alter) I object!   FIONA Shrek?  The whole congregation gasps as they see Shrek.  FARQUAAD Oh, now what does he want?  SHREK (to congregation as he reaches the front  of the Church) Hi, everyone. Havin'  a good time, are ya? I love DuLoc, first  of all. Very clean.  FIONA What are you doing here?  SHREK Really, it's rude enough being alive  when no one wants you, but showing up  uninvited to a wedding...  SHREK Fiona! I need to talk to you.  FIONA Oh, now you wanna talk? It's a little  late for that, so if you'll excuse me  - -  SHREK But you can't marry him.  FIONA And why not?  SHREK Because- - Because he's just marring  you so he can be king.  FARQUAAD Outrageous! Fiona, don't listen to him.   SHREK He's not your true love.  FIONA And what do you know about true love?   SHREK Well, I - - Uh - - I mean - -  FARQUAAD Oh, this is precious. The ogee has fallen  in love with the princess! Oh, good  Lord. (laughs)  The prompter card guy holds up a card that says 'Laugh'. The  whole congregation laughs.  FARQUAAD An ogre and a princess!  FIONA Shrek, is this true?  FARQUAAD Who cares? It's preposterous! Fiona,  my love, we're but a kiss away from  our \"happily ever after.\" Now kiss me!  (puckers his lips and leans toward her,  but she pulls back.)  FIONA (looking at the setting sun) \"By night  one way, by day another.\" (to Shrek)  I wanted to show you before.  She backs up and as the sun sets she changes into her ogre self.  She gives Shrek a sheepish smile.  SHREK Well, uh, that explains a lot. (Fiona  smiles)  FARQUAAD Ugh! It's disgusting! Guards! Guards!  I order you to get that out of my sight  now! Get them! Get them both!  The guards run in and separate Fiona and Shrek. Shrek fights  them.  SHREK No, no!  FIONA Shrek!  FARQUAAD This hocus-pocus alters nothing. This  marriage is binding, and that makes  me king! See? See?  FIONA No, let go of me! Shrek!  SHREK No!  FARQUAAD Don't just stand there, you morons.   SHREK Get out of my way! Fiona! Arrgh!  FARQUAAD I'll make you regret the day we met.  I'll see you drawn and quartered! You'll  beg for death to save you!  FIONA No, Shrek!  FARQUAAD (hold a dagger to Fiona's throat) And  as for you, my wife...  SHREK Fiona!  FARQUAAD I'll have you locked back in that tower  for the rest of your days! I'm king!   Shrek manages to get a hand free and he whistles.  FARQUAAD I will have order! I will have perfection!  I will have - - (Donkey and the dragon  show up and the dragon leans down and  eats Farquaad) Aaaah! Aah!  DONKEY All right. Nobody move. I got a dragon  here, and I'm not afraid to use it.  (The dragon roars.) I'm a donkey on  the edge!  The dragon belches and Farquaad's crown flies out of her mouth  and falls to the ground.  DONKEY Celebrity marriages. They never last,  do they?  The congregation cheers.  DONKEY Go ahead, Shrek.  SHREK Uh, Fiona?  FIONA Yes, Shrek?  SHREK I - - I love you.  FIONA Really?  SHREK Really, really.  FIONA (smiles) I love you too.  Shrek and Fiona kiss. Thelonius takes one of the cards and writes  'Awwww' on the back and then shows it to the congregation.   CONGREGATION Aawww!  Suddenly the magic of the spell pulls Fiona away. She's lifted  up into the air and she hovers there while the magic works around  her.  WHISPERS \"Until you find true love's first kiss  and then take love's true form. Take  love's true form. Take love's true form.\"   Suddenly Fiona's eyes open wide. She's consumed by the spell  and then is slowly lowered to the ground.  SHREK (going over to her) Fiona? Fiona. Are  you all right?  FIONA (standing up, she's still an ogre) Well,  yes. But I don't understand. I'm supposed  to be beautiful.  SHREK But you ARE beautiful.  They smile at each other.  DONKEY (chuckles) I was hoping this would be  a happy ending.  Shrek and Fiona kiss...and the kiss fades into...  THE SWAMP  ...their wedding kiss. Shrek and Fiona are now married. 'I'm  a Believer' by Smashmouth is played in the background. Shrek  and Fiona break apart and run through the crowd to their awaiting  carriage. Which is made of a giant onion. Fiona tosses her bouquet  which both Cinderella and Snow White try to catch. But they end  up getting into a cat fight and so the dragon catches the bouquet  instead. The Gingerbread man has been mended somewhat and now  has one leg and walks with a candy cane cane. Shrek and Fiona  walk off as the rest of the guests party and Donkey takes over  singing the song.  GINGERBREAD MAN God bless us, every one.  DONKEY (as he's done singing and we fade to  black) Oh, that's funny. Oh. Oh. I can't  breathe. I can't breathe.",
  "descricao": "SHREK\nOnce upon a time there was a lovely \nprincess. But she had an enchantment \nupon her of a fearful sort which could \nonly be broken by love's first kiss. \nShe was locked away in a castle guarded \nby a terrible fire-breathing dragon. \nMany brave knights had attempted to \nfree her from this dreadful prison, \nbut non prevailed. She waited in the \ndragon's keep in the highest room of \nthe tallest tower for her true love \nand true love's first kiss. (laughs) \nLike that's ever gonna happen. What \na load of - (toilet flush)\n\nAllstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his \nday. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go \nafter the ogre.\n\nNIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOME\n\nMAN1\nThink it's in there?\n\nMAN2\nAll right. Let's get it!\n\nMAN1\nWhoa. Hold on. Do you know what that \nthing can do to you?\n\nMAN3\nYeah, it'll grind your bones for it's \nbread.\n\nShrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.\n\nSHREK\nYes, well, actually, that would be a \ngiant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. \nThey'll make a suit from your freshly \npeeled skin.\n\nMEN\nNo!\n\nSHREK\nThey'll shave your liver. Squeeze the \njelly from your eyes! Actually, it's \nquite good on toast.\n\nMAN1\nBack! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! \n(waves the torch at Shrek.)\n\nShrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The \nmen shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long \nand his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the \nmen are in the dark.\n\nSHREK\nThis is the part where you run away. \n(The men scramble to get away. He laughs.) \nAnd stay out! (looks down and picks \nup a piece of paper. Reads.) \"Wanted. \nFairy tale creatures.\"(He sighs and \nthrows the paper over his shoulder.)\n\n\nTHE NEXT DAY\n\nThere is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard \nsits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures \nto him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line \nare Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto \nwho's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three \nlittle pigs.\n\nGUARD\nAll right. This one's full. Take it \naway! Move it along. Come on! Get up!\n\n\nHEAD GUARD\nNext!\n\nGUARD\n(taking the witch's broom) Give me that! \nYour flying days are over. (breaks the \nbroom in half)\n\nHEAD GUARD\nThat's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. \nNext!\n\nGUARD\nGet up! Come on!\n\nHEAD GUARD\nTwenty pieces.\n\nLITTLE BEAR\n(crying) This cage is too small.\n\nDONKEY\nPlease, don't turn me in. I'll never \nbe stubborn again. I can change. Please! \nGive me another chance!\n\nOLD WOMAN\nOh, shut up. (jerks his rope)\n\nDONKEY\nOh!\n\nHEAD GUARD\nNext! What have you got?\n\nGIPETTO\nThis little wooden puppet.\n\nPINOCCHIO\nI'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. (his \nnose grows)\n\nHEAD GUARD\nFive shillings for the possessed toy. \nTake it away.\n\nPINOCCHIO\nFather, please! Don't let them do this! \nHelp me!\n\nGipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up \nto the table.\n\nHEAD GUARD\nNext! What have you got?\n\nOLD WOMAN\nWell, I've got a talking donkey.\n\nHEAD GUARD\nRight. Well, that's good for ten shillings, \nif you can prove it.\n\nOLD WOMAN\nOh, go ahead, little fella.\n\nDonkey just looks up at her.\n\nHEAD GUARD\nWell?\n\nOLD WOMAN\nOh, oh, he's just...he's just a little \nnervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. \nTalk, you boneheaded dolt...\n\nHEAD GUARD\nThat's it. I've heard enough. Guards!\n\n\nOLD WOMAN\nNo, no, he talks! He does. (pretends \nto be Donkey) I can talk. I love to \ntalk. I'm the talkingest damn thing \nyou ever saw.\n\nHEAD GUARD\nGet her out of my sight.\n\nOLD WOMAN\nNo, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk!\n\nThe guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One \nof her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's \nhands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled \nwith fairy dust and he's able to fly.\n\nDONKEY\nHey! I can fly!\n\nPETER PAN\nHe can fly!\n\n3 LITTLE PIGS\nHe can fly!\n\nHEAD GUARD\nHe can talk!\n\nDONKEY\nHa, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm \na flying, talking donkey. You might \nhave seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly \nbut I bet you ain't never seen a donkey \nfly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins \nto wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink \nto the ground.)\n\nHe hits the ground with a thud.\n\nHEAD GUARD\nSeize him! (Donkey takes of running.) \nAfter him!\n\nGUARDS\nHe's getting away! Get him! This way! \nTurn!\n\nDonkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally. \nShrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared \nfor a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He \nquickly hides behind Shrek.\n\nHEAD GUARD\nYou there. Ogre!\n\nSHREK\nAye?\n\nHEAD GUARD\nBy the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized \nto place you both under arrest and transport \nyou to a designated resettlement facility.\n\n\nSHREK\nOh, really? You and what army?\n\nHe looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well \nand we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail \nand runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and \nbegins walking back to his cottage.\n\nDONKEY\nCan I say something to you? Listen, \nyou was really, really, really somethin' \nback here. Incredible!\n\nSHREK\nAre you talkin' to...(he turns around \nand Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back \naround and Donkey is right in front \nof him.) Whoa!\n\nDONKEY\nYes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell \nyou that you that you was great back \nhere? Those guards! They thought they \nwas all of that. Then you showed up, \nand bam! They was trippin' over themselves \nlike babes in the woods. That really \nmade me feel good to see that.\n\nSHREK\nOh, that's great. Really.\n\nDONKEY\nMan, it's good to be free.\n\nSHREK\nNow, why don't you go celebrate your \nfreedom with your own friends? Hmm?\n\n\nDONKEY\nBut, uh, I don't have any friends. And \nI'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, \nwait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll \nstick with you. You're mean, green, \nfightin' machine. Together we'll scare \nthe spit out of anybody that crosses \nus.\n\nShrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very \nloudly.\n\nDONKEY\nOh, wow! That was really scary. If you \ndon't mind me sayin', if that don't \nwork, your breath certainly will get \nthe job done, 'cause you definitely \nneed some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause \nyou breath stinks! You almost burned \nthe hair outta my nose, just like the \ntime...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey \ncontinues to talk, so Shrek removes \nhis hand.) ...then I ate some rotten \nberries. I had strong gases leaking \nout of my butt that day.\n\nSHREK\nWhy are you following me?\n\nDONKEY\nI'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause \nI'm all alone, There's no one here beside \nme, My problems have all gone, There's \nno one to deride me, But you gotta have \nfaith...\n\nSHREK\nStop singing! It's no wonder you don't \nhave any friends.\n\nDONKEY\nWow. Only a true friend would be that \ncruelly honest.\n\nSHREK\nListen, little donkey. Take a look at \nme. What am I?\n\nDONKEY\n(looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really \ntall?\n\nSHREK\nNo! I'm an ogre! You know. \"Grab your \ntorch and pitchforks.\" Doesn't that \nbother you?\n\nDONKEY\nNope.\n\nSHREK\nReally?\n\nDONKEY\nReally, really.\n\nSHREK\nOh.\n\nDONKEY\nMan, I like you. What's you name?\n\nSHREK\nUh, Shrek.\n\nDONKEY\nShrek? Well, you know what I like about \nyou, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me \nthing. I like that. I respect that, \nShrek. You all right. (They come over \na hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.) \nWhoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live \nin place like that?\n\nSHREK\nThat would be my home.\n\nDONKEY\nOh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. \nYou know you are quite a decorator. \nIt's amazing what you've done with such \na modest budget. I like that boulder. \nThat is a nice boulder. I guess you \ndon't entertain much, do you?\n\nSHREK\nI like my privacy.\n\nDONKEY\nYou know, I do too. That's another thing \nwe have in common. Like I hate it when \nyou got somebody in your face. You've \ntrying to give them a hint, and they \nwon't leave. There's that awkward silence. \n(awkward silence) Can I stay with you?\n\n\nSHREK\nUh, what?\n\nDONKEY\nCan I stay with you, please?\n\nSHREK\n(sarcastically) Of course!\n\nDONKEY\nReally?\n\nSHREK\nNo.\n\nDONKEY\nPlease! I don't wanna go back there! \nYou don't know what it's like to be \nconsidered a freak. (pause while he \nlooks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do. \nBut that's why we gotta stick together. \nYou gotta let me stay! Please! Please!\n\n\nSHREK\nOkay! Okay! But one night only.\n\nDONKEY\nAh! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage)\n\n\nSHREK\nWhat are you...? (Donkey hops up onto \na chair.) No! No!\n\nDONKEY\nThis is gonna be fun! We can stay up \nlate, swappin' manly stories, and in \nthe mornin' I'm makin' waffles.\n\nSHREK\nOh!\n\nDONKEY\nWhere do, uh, I sleep?\n\nSHREK\n(irritated) Outside!\n\nDONKEY\nOh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, \nI don't know you, and you don't know \nme, so I guess outside is best, you \nknow. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek \nslams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do \nlike the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was \nborn outside. I'll just be sitting by \nmyself outside, I guess, you know. By \nmyself, outside. I'm all alone...there's \nno one here beside me...\n\nSHREK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT\n\nShrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights \na candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a \nnoise. He stands up with a huff.\n\nSHREK\n(to Donkey) I thought I told you to \nstay outside.\n\nDONKEY\n(from the window) I am outside.\n\nThere is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that \nmade the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns \nand spots 3 blind mice on his table.\n\nBLIND MOUSE1\nWell, gents, it's a far cry from the \nfarm, but what choice do we have?\n\n\nBLIND MOUSE2\nIt's not home, but it'll do just fine.\n\n\nGORDO\n(bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed.\n\n\nSHREK\nGot ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes \nand lands on his shoulder.)\n\nGORDO\nI found some cheese. (bites Shrek's \near)\n\nSHREK\nOw!\n\nGORDO\nBlah! Awful stuff.\n\nBLIND MOUSE1\nIs that you, Gordo?\n\nGORDO\nHow did you know?\n\nSHREK\nEnough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are \nyou doing in my house? (He gets bumped \nfrom behind and he drops the mice.) \nHey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves \nwith Snow White on the table.) Oh, no, \nno, no. Dead broad off the table.\n\n\nDWARF\nWhere are we supposed to put her? The \nbed's taken.\n\nSHREK\nHuh?\n\nShrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain. \nThe Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at \nhim.\n\nBIG BAD WOLF\nWhat?\n\nTIME LAPSE\n\nShrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging \nhim to the front door.\n\nSHREK\nI live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm \na terrifying ogre! What do I have to \ndo get a little privacy? (He opens the \nfront door to throw the Wolf out and \nhe sees that all the collected Fairy \nTale Creatures are on his land.) Oh, \nno. No! No!\n\nThe 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his \npipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing \nflight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.\n\n\nSHREK\nWhat are you doing in my swamp? (this \nechoes and everyone falls silent.)\n\n\nGasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a \ntent.\n\nSHREK\nAll right, get out of here. All of you, \nmove it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! \nHapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more \ndwarves run inside the house) No, no! \nNo, no. Not there. Not there. (they \nshut the door on him) Oh! (turns to \nlook at Donkey)\n\nDONKEY\nHey, don't look at me. I didn't invite \nthem.\n\nPINOCCHIO\nOh, gosh, no one invited us.\n\nSHREK\nWhat?\n\nPINOCCHIO\nWe were forced to come here.\n\nSHREK\n(flabbergasted) By who?\n\nLITTLE PIG\nLord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed \nand he...signed an eviction notice.\n\n\nSHREK\n(heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where \nthis Farquaad guy is?\n\nEveryone looks around at each other but no one answers.\n\nDONKEY\nOh, I do. I know where he is.\n\nSHREK\nDoes anyone else know where to find \nhim? Anyone at all?\n\nDONKEY\nMe! Me!\n\nSHREK\nAnyone?\n\nDONKEY\nOh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! \nMe, me!\n\nSHREK\n(sigh) Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy \ntale things. Do not get comfortable. \nYour welcome is officially worn out. \nIn fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad \nright now and get you all off my land \nand back where you came from! (Pause. \nThen the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey) \nYou! You're comin' with me.\n\nDONKEY\nAll right, that's what I like to hear, \nman. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart \nfriends, off on a whirlwind big-city \nadventure. I love it!\n\nDONKEY\n(singing) On the road again. Sing it \nwith me, Shrek. I can't wait to get \non the road again.\n\nSHREK\nWhat did I say about singing?\n\nDONKEY\nCan I whistle?\n\nSHREK\nNo.\n\nDONKEY\nCan I hum it?\n\nSHREK\nAll right, hum it.\n\nDonkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'.\n\nDULOC - KITCHEN\n\nA masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He's continually \ndunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in.\n\nFARQUAAD\nThat's enough. He's ready to talk.\n\n\nThe Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down \nonto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the \ntable. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes \nup to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.\n\n\nFARQUAAD\n(he picks up the Gingerbread Man's legs \nand plays with them) Run, run, run, \nas fast as you can. You can't catch \nme. I'm the gingerbread man.\n\nGINGERBREAD MAN\nYou are a monster.\n\nFARQUAAD\nI'm not the monster here. You are. You \nand the rest of that fairy tale trash, \npoisoning my perfect world. Now, tell \nme! Where are the others?\n\nGINGERBREAD MAN\nEat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad's \neye.)\n\nFARQUAAD\nI've tried to be fair to you creatures. \nNow my patience has reached its end! \nTell me or I'll...(he makes as if to \npull off the Gingerbread Man's buttons)\n\n\nGINGERBREAD MAN\nNo, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop \nbuttons.\n\nFARQUAAD\nAll right then. Who's hiding them?\n\n\nGINGERBREAD MAN\nOkay, I'll tell you. Do you know the \nmuffin man?\n\nFARQUAAD\nThe muffin man?\n\nGINGERBREAD MAN\nThe muffin man.\n\nFARQUAAD\nYes, I know the muffin man, who lives \non Drury Lane?\n\nGINGERBREAD MAN\nWell, she's married to the muffin man.\n\n\nFARQUAAD\nThe muffin man?\n\nGINGERBREAD MAN\nThe muffin man!\n\nFARQUAAD\nShe's married to the muffin man.\n\nThe door opens and the Head Guard walks in.\n\nHEAD GUARD\nMy lord! We found it.\n\nFARQUAAD\nThen what are you waiting for? Bring \nit in.\n\nMore guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet. \nThey hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic \nMirror.\n\nGINGERBREAD MAN\n(in awe) Ohhhh...\n\nFARQUAAD\nMagic mirror...\n\nGINGERBREAD MAN\nDon't tell him anything! (Farquaad picks \nhim up and dumps him into a trash can \nwith a lid.) No!\n\nFARQUAAD\nEvening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. \nIs this not the most perfect kingdom \nof them all?\n\nMIRROR\nWell, technically you're not a king.\n\n\nFARQUAAD\nUh, Thelonius. (Thelonius holds up a \nhand mirror and smashes it with his \nfist.) You were saying?\n\nMIRROR\nWhat I mean is you're not a king yet. \nBut you can become one. All you have \nto do is marry a princess.\n\nFARQUAAD\nGo on.\n\nMIRROR\n(chuckles nervously) So, just sit back \nand relax, my lord, because it's time \nfor you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. \nAnd here they are! Bachelorette number \none is a mentally abused shut-in from \na kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi \nand hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies \ninclude cooking and cleaning for her \ntwo evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. \n(shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette \nnumber two is a cape-wearing girl from \nthe land of fancy. Although she lives \nwith seven other men, she's not easy. \nJust kiss her dead, frozen lips and \nfind out what a live wire she is. Come \non. Give it up for Snow White! (shows \npicture of Snow White) And last, but \ncertainly not last, bachelorette number \nthree is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded \ncastle surrounded by hot boiling lava! \nBut don't let that cool you off. She's \na loaded pistol who likes pina colads \nand getting caught in the rain. Yours \nfor the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows \npicture of Princess Fiona) So will it \nbe bachelorette number one, bachelorette \nnumber two or bachelorette number three?\n\n\nGUARDS\nTwo! Two! Three! Three! Two! Two! Three!\n\n\nFARQUAAD\nThree? One? Three?\n\nTHELONIUS\nThree! (holds up 2 fingers) Pick number \nthree, my lord!\n\nFARQUAAD\nOkay, okay, uh, number three!\n\nMIRROR\nLord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess \nFiona.\n\nFARQUAAD\nPrincess Fiona. She's perfect. All I \nhave to do is just find someone who \ncan go...\n\nMIRROR\nBut I probably should mention the little \nthing that happens at night.\n\nFARQUAAD\nI'll do it.\n\nMIRROR\nYes, but after sunset...\n\nFARQUAAD\nSilence! I will make this Princess Fiona \nmy queen, and DuLoc will finally have \nthe perfect king! Captain, assemble \nyour finest men. We're going to have \na tournament. (smiles evilly)\n\nDuLoc Parking Lot - Lancelot Section\n\nShrek and Donkey come out of the field that is right by the parking \nlot. The castle itself is about 40 stories high.\n\nDONKEY\nBut that's it. That's it right there. \nThat's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it.\n\n\nSHREK\nSo, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle.\n\n\nDONKEY\nUh-huh. That's the place.\n\nSHREK\nDo you think maybe he's compensating \nfor something? (He laughs, but then \ngroans as Donkey doesn't get the joke. \nHe continues walking through the parking \nlot.)\n\nDONKEY\nHey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.\n\nMAN\nHurry, darling. We're late. Hurry.\n\n\nSHREK\nHey, you! (The attendant, who is wearing \na giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad, \nscreams and begins running through the \nrows of rope to get to the front gate \nto get away from Shrek.) Wait a second. \nLook, I'm not gonna eat you. I just \n- - I just - - (He sighs and then begins \nwalking straight through the rows. The \nattendant runs into a wall and falls \ndown. Shrek and Donkey look at him then \ncontinue on into DuLoc.)\n\nDULOC\n\nThey look around but all is quiet.\n\nSHREK\nIt's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody?\n\n\nDONKEY\nHey, look at this!\n\nDonkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box \nmarked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors \nopen up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin \nto sing.\n\nWOODEN PEOPLE\nWelcome to DuLoc such a perfect town\n\n\nHere we have some rules\n\nLet us lay them down\n\nDon't make waves, stay in line\n\nAnd we'll get along fine\n\nDuLoc is perfect place\n\nPlease keep off of the grass\n\nShine your shoes, wipe your... face\n\nDuLoc is, DuLoc is\n\nDuLoc is perfect place.\n\nSuddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek's picture.\n\nDONKEY\nWow! Let's do that again! (makes ready \nto run over and pull the lever again)\n\n\nSHREK\n(grabs Donkey's tail and holds him still) \nNo. No. No, no, no! No.\n\nThey hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena.\n\nFARQUAAD\nBrave knights. You are the best and \nbrightest in all the land. Today one \nof you shall prove himself...\n\nAs Shrek and Donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena \nDonkey is humming the DuLoc theme song.\n\nSHREK\nAll right. You're going the right way \nfor a smacked bottom.\n\nDONKEY\nSorry about that.\n\nFARQUAAD\nThat champion shall have the honor - \n- no, no - - the privilege to go forth \nand rescue the lovely Princess Fiona \nfrom the fiery keep of the dragon. If \nfor any reason the winner is unsuccessful, \nthe first runner-up will take his place \nand so on and so forth. Some of you \nmay die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing \nto make. (cheers) Let the tournament \nbegin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is \nthat? It's hideous!\n\nSHREK\n(turns to look at Donkey and then back \nat Farquaad) Ah, that's not very nice. \nIt's just a donkey.\n\nFARQUAAD\nIndeed. Knights, new plan! The one who \nkills the ogre will be named champion! \nHave it him!\n\nMEN\nGet him!\n\nSHREK\nOh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps \ninto a table where there are mugs of \nbeer)\n\nCROWD\nGo ahead! Get him!\n\nSHREK\n(holds up a mug of beer) Can't we just \nsettle this over a pint?\n\nCROWD\nKill the beast!\n\nSHREK\nNo? All right then. (drinks the beer) \nCome on!\n\nHe takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel \nof beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the \nother men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides \npast the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped. \nAs Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger \nbeer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll. \nDonkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much \nfighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice \nto say that Shrek kicks butt.\n\nDONKEY\nHey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me!\n\nShrek comes over and bangs a man's head up against Donkeys. Shrek \ngets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd.\n\nSHREK\nYeah!\n\nA man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time \nand sees him.\n\nWOMAN\nThe chair! Give him the chair!\n\nShrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men \nare down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding \nsounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild.\n\nSHREK\nOh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you \nvery much! I'm here till Thursday. Try \nthe veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)\n\nThe laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on \nShrek.\n\nHEAD GUARD\nShall I give the order, sir?\n\nFARQUAAD\nNo, I have a better idea. People of \nDuLoc, I give you our champion!\n\nSHREK\nWhat?\n\nFARQUAAD\nCongratulations, ogre. You're won the \nhonor of embarking on a great and noble \nquest.\n\nSHREK\nQuest? I'm already in a quest, a quest \nto get my swamp back.\n\nFARQUAAD\nYour swamp?\n\nSHREK\nYeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those \nfairy tale creatures!\n\nFARQUAAD\nIndeed. All right, ogre. I'll make you \na deal. Go on this quest for me, and \nI'll give you your swamp back.\n\nSHREK\nExactly the way it was?\n\nFARQUAAD\nDown to the last slime-covered toadstool.\n\n\nSHREK\nAnd the squatters?\n\nFARQUAAD\nAs good as gone.\n\nSHREK\nWhat kind of quest?\n\nTime Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field \nheading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion.\n\nDONKEY\nLet me get this straight. You're gonna \ngo fight a dragon and rescue a princess \njust so Farquaad will give you back \na swamp which you only don't have because \nhe filled it full of freaks in the first \nplace. Is that about right?\n\nSHREK\nYou know, maybe there's a good reason \ndonkeys shouldn't talk.\n\nDONKEY\nI don't get it. Why don't you just pull \nsome of that ogre stuff on him? Throttle \nhim, lay siege to his fortress, grinds \nhis bones to make your bread, the whole \nogre trip.\n\nSHREK\nOh, I know what. Maybe I could have \ndecapitated an entire village and put \ntheir heads on a pike, gotten a knife, \ncut open their spleen and drink their \nfluids. Does that sound good to you?\n\n\nDONKEY\nUh, no, not really, no.\n\nSHREK\nFor your information, there's a lot \nmore to ogres than people think.\n\nDONKEY\nExample?\n\nSHREK\nExample? Okay, um, ogres are like onions. \n(he holds out his onion)\n\nDONKEY\n(sniffs the onion) They stink?\n\nSHREK\nYes - - No!\n\nDONKEY\nThey make you cry?\n\nSHREK\nNo!\n\nDONKEY\nYou leave them in the sun, they get \nall brown, start sproutin' little white \nhairs.\n\nSHREK\nNo! Layers! Onions have layers. Ogres \nhave layers! Onions have layers. You \nget it? We both have layers. (he heaves \na sigh and then walks off)\n\nDONKEY\n(trailing after Shrek) Oh, you both \nhave layers. Oh. {Sniffs} You know, \nnot everybody likes onions. Cake! Everybody \nloves cakes! Cakes have layers.\n\nSHREK\nI don't care... what everyone likes. \nOgres are not like cakes.\n\nDONKEY\nYou know what else everybody likes? \nParfaits. Have you ever met a person, \nyou say, \"Let's get some parfait,\" they \nsay, \"Hell no, I don't like no parfait\"? \nParfaits are delicious.\n\nSHREK\nNo! You dense, irritating, miniature \nbeast of burden! Ogres are like onions! \nAnd of story. Bye-bye. See ya later.\n\n\nDONKEY\nParfaits may be the most delicious thing \non the whole damn planet.\n\nSHREK\nYou know, I think I preferred your humming.\n\n\nDONKEY\nDo you have a tissue or something? I'm \nmaking a mess. Just the word parfait \nmake me start slobbering.\n\nThey head off. There is a montage of their journey. Walking through \na field at sunset. Sleeping beneath a bright moon. Shrek trying \nto put the campfire out the next day and having a bit of a problem, \nso Donkey pees on the fire to put it out.\n\nDRAGON'S KEEP\n\nShrek and Donkey are walking up to the keep that's supposed to \nhouse Princess Fiona. It appears to look like a giant volcano.\n\n\nDONKEY\n(sniffs) Ohh! Shrek! Did you do that? \nYou gotta warn somebody before you just \ncrack one off. My mouth was open and \neverything.\n\nSHREK\nBelieve me, Donkey, if it was me, you'd \nbe dead. (sniffs) It's brimstone. We \nmust be getting close.\n\nDONKEY\nYeah, right, brimstone. Don't be talking \nabout it's the brimstone. I know what \nI smell. It wasn't no brimstone. It \ndidn't come off no stone neither.\n\n\nThey climb up the side of the volcano/keep and look down. There \nis a small piece of rock right in the center and that is where \nthe castle is. It is surrounded by boiling lava. It looks very \nforeboding.\n\nSHREK\nSure, it's big enough, but look at the \nlocation. (laughs...then the laugh turns \ninto a groan)\n\nDONKEY\nUh, Shrek? Uh, remember when you said \nogres have layers?\n\nSHREK\nOh, aye.\n\nDONKEY\nWell, I have a bit of a confession to \nmake. Donkeys don't have layers. We \nwear our fear right out there on our \nsleeves.\n\nSHREK\nWait a second. Donkeys don't have sleeves.\n\n\nDONKEY\nYou know what I mean.\n\nSHREK\nYou can't tell me you're afraid of heights.\n\n\nDONKEY\nNo, I'm just a little uncomfortable \nabout being on a rickety bridge over \na boiling like of lava!\n\nSHREK\nCome on, Donkey. I'm right here beside \nya, okay? For emotional support., we'll \njust tackle this thing together one \nlittle baby step at a time.\n\nDONKEY\nReally?\n\nSHREK\nReally, really.\n\nDONKEY\nOkay, that makes me feel so much better.\n\n\nSHREK\nJust keep moving. And don't look down.\n\n\nDONKEY\nOkay, don't look down. Don't look down. \nDon't look down. Keep on moving. Don't \nlook down. (he steps through a rotting \nboard and ends up looking straight down \ninto the lava) Shrek! I'm lookin' down! \nOh, God, I can't do this! Just let me \noff, please!\n\nSHREK\nBut you're already halfway.\n\nDONKEY\nBut I know that half is safe!\n\nSHREK\nOkay, fine. I don't have time for this. \nYou go back.\n\nDONKEY\nShrek, no! Wait!\n\nSHREK\nJust, Donkey - - Let's have a dance \nthen, shall me? (bounces and sways the \nbridge)\n\nDONKEY\nDon't do that!\n\nSHREK\nOh, I'm sorry. Do what? Oh, this? (bounces \nthe bridge again)\n\nDONKEY\nYes, that!\n\nSHREK\nYes? Yes, do it. Okay. (continues to \nbounce and sway as he backs Donkey across \nthe bridge)\n\nDONKEY\nNo, Shrek! No! Stop it!\n\nSHREK\nYou said do it! I'm doin' it.\n\nDONKEY\nI'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. Shrek, \nI'm gonna die. (steps onto solid ground) \nOh!\n\nSHREK\nThat'll do, Donkey. That'll do. (walks \ntowards the castle)\n\nDONKEY\nCool. So where is this fire-breathing \npain-in-the-neck anyway?\n\nSHREK\nInside, waiting for us to rescue her. \n(chuckles)\n\nDONKEY\nI was talkin' about the dragon, Shrek.\n\n\nINSIDE THE CASTLE\n\nDONKEY\nYou afraid?\n\nSHREK\nNo.\n\nDONKEY\nBut...\n\nSHREK\nShh.\n\nDONKEY\nOh, good. Me neither. (sees a skeleton \nand gasps) 'Cause there's nothin' wrong \nwith bein' afraid. Fear's a sensible \nresponse to an unfamiliar situation. \nUnfamiliar dangerous situation, I might \nadd. With a dragon that breathes fire \nand eats knights and breathes fire, \nit sure doesn't mean you're a coward \nif you're a little scared. I sure as \nheck ain't no coward. I know that.\n\n\nSHREK\nDonkey, two things, okay? Shut ... up. \nNow go over there and see if you can \nfind any stairs.\n\nDONKEY\nStairs? I thought we was lookin' for \nthe princess.\n\nSHREK\n(putting on a helmet) The princess will \nbe up the stairs in the highest room \nin the tallest tower.\n\nDONKEY\nWhat makes you think she'll be there?\n\n\nSHREK\nI read it in a book once. (walks off)\n\n\nDONKEY\nCool. You handle the dragon. I'll handle \nthe stairs. I'll find those stairs. \nI'll whip their butt too. Those stairs \nwon't know which way they're goin'. \n(walks off)\n\nEMPTY ROOM\n\nDonkey is still talking to himself as he looks around the room.\n\n\nDONKEY\nI'm gonna take drastic steps. Kick it \nto the curb. Don't mess with me. I'm \nthe stair master. I've mastered the \nstairs. I wish I had a step right here. \nI'd step all over it.\n\nELSEWHERE\n\nShrek spots a light in the tallest tower window.\n\nSHREK\nWell, at least we know where the princess \nis, but where's the...\n\nDONKEY\n(os) Dragon!\n\nDonkey gasps and takes off running as the dragon roars again. \nShrek manages to grab Donkey out of the way just as the dragon \nbreathes fire.\n\nSHREK\nDonkey, look out! (he manages to get \na hold of the dragons tail and holds \non) Got ya!\n\nThe dragon gets irritated at this and flicks it's tail and Shrek \ngoes flying through the air and crashes through the roof of the \ntallest tower. Fiona wakes up with a jerk and looks at him lying \non the floor.\n\nDONKEY\nOh! Aah! Aah!\n\nDonkey get cornered as the Dragon knocks away all but a small \npart of the bridge he's on.\n\nDONKEY\nNo. Oh, no, No! (the dragon roars) Oh, \nwhat large teeth you have. (the dragon \ngrowls) I mean white, sparkling teeth. \nI know you probably hear this all time \nfrom your food, but you must bleach, \n'cause that is one dazzling smile you \ngot there. Do I detect a hint of minty \nfreshness? And you know what else? You're \n- - You're a girl dragon! Oh, sure! \nI mean, of course you're a girl dragon. \nYou're just reeking of feminine beauty. \n(the dragon begins fluttering her eyes \nat him) What's the matter with you? \nYou got something in your eye? Ohh. \nOh. Oh. Man, I'd really love to stay, \nbut you know, I'm, uh...(the dragon \nblows a smoke ring in the shape of a \nheart right at him, and he coughs) I'm \nan asthmatic, and I don't know if it'd \nwork out if you're gonna blow smoke \nrings. Shrek! (the dragon picks him \nup with her teeth and carries him off) \nNo! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!\n\nFIONA'S ROOM\n\nShrek groans as he gets up off the floor. His back is to Fiona \nso she straightens her dress and lays back down on the bed. She \nthen quickly reaches over and gets the bouquet of flowers off \nthe side table. She then lays back down and appears to be asleep. \nShrek turns and goes over to her. He looks down at Fiona for \na moment and she puckers her lips. Shrek takes her by the shoulders \nand shakes her away.\n\nFIONA\nOh! Oh!\n\nSHREK\nWake up!\n\nFIONA\nWhat?\n\nSHREK\nAre you Princess Fiona?\n\nFIONA\nI am, awaiting a knight so bold as to \nrescue me.\n\nSHREK\nOh, that's nice. Now let's go!\n\nFIONA\nBut wait, Sir Knight. This be-ith our \nfirst meeting. Should it not be a wonderful, \nromantic moment?\n\nSHREK\nYeah, sorry, lady. There's no time.\n\n\nFIONA\nHey, wait. What are you doing? You should \nsweep me off my feet out yonder window \nand down a rope onto your valiant steed.\n\n\nSHREK\nYou've had a lot of time to plan this, \nhaven't you?\n\nFIONA\n(smiles) Mm-hmm.\n\nShrek breaks the lock on her door and pulls her out and down \nthe hallway.\n\nFIONA\nBut we have to savor this moment! You \ncould recite an epic poem for me. A \nballad? A sonnet! A limerick? Or something!\n\n\nSHREK\nI don't think so.\n\nFIONA\nCan I at least know the name of my champion?\n\n\nSHREK\nUh, Shrek.\n\nFIONA\nSir Shrek. (clears throat and holds \nout a handkerchief) I pray that you \ntake this favor as a token of my gratitude.\n\n\nSHREK\nThanks!\n\nSuddenly they hear the dragon roar.\n\nFIONA\n(surprised)You didn't slay the dragon?\n\n\nSHREK\nIt's on my to-do list. Now come on! \n(takes off running and drags Fiona behind \nhim.)\n\nFIONA\nBut this isn't right! You were meant \nto charge in, sword drawn, banner flying. \nThat's what all the other knights did.\n\n\nSHREK\nYeah, right before they burst into flame.\n\n\nFIONA\nThat's not the point. (Shrek suddenly \nstops and she runs into him.) Oh! (Shrek \nignores her and heads for a wooden door \noff to the side.) Wait. Where are you \ngoing? The exit's over there.\n\nSHREK\nWell, I have to save my ass.\n\nFIONA\nWhat kind of knight are you?\n\nSHREK\nOne of a kind. (opens the door into \nthe throne room)\n\nDONKEY\n(os) Slow down. Slow down, baby, please. \nI believe it's healthy to get to know \nsomeone over a long period of time. \nJust call me old-fashioned. (laughs \nworriedly) (we see him up close and \nfrom a distance as Shrek sneaks into \nthe room) I don't want to rush into \na physical relationship. I'm not emotionally \nready for a commitment of, uh, this \n- - Magnitude really is the word I'm \nlooking for. Magnitude- - Hey, that \nis unwanted physical contact. Hey, what \nare you doing? Okay, okay. Let's just \nback up a little and take this one step \nat a time. We really should get to know \neach other first as friends or pen pals. \nI'm on the road a lot, but I just love \nreceiving cards - - I'd really love \nto stay, but - - Don't do that! That's \nmy tail! That's my personal tail. You're \ngonna tear it off. I don't give permission \n- - What are you gonna do with that? \nHey, now. No way. No! No! No, no! No. \nNo, no, no. No! Oh!\n\nShrek grabs a chain that's connected to the chandelier and swings \ntoward the dragon. He misses and he swings back again. He looks \nup and spots that the chandelier is right above the dragons head. \nHe pulls on the chain and it releases and he falls down and bumps \nDonkey out of the way right as the dragon is about to kiss him. \nInstead the dragon kisses Shreks' butt. She opens her eyes and \nroars. Shrek lets go of the chain and the chandelier falls onto \nher head, but it's too big and it goes over her head and forms \na sort of collar for her. She roars again and Shrek and Donkey \ntake off running. Very 'Matrix' style. Shrek grabs Donkey and \nthen grabs Princess Fiona as he runs past her.\n\nDONKEY\nHi, Princess!\n\nFIONA\nIt talks!\n\nSHREK\nYeah, it's getting him to shut up that's \nthe trick.\n\nThey all start screaming as the dragon gains on them. Shrek spots \na descending slide and jumps on. But unfortunately there is a \ncrack in the stone and it hits Shrek right in the groin. His \neyes cross and as he reaches the bottom of the slide he stumbles \noff and walks lightly.\n\nSHREK\nOh!\n\nShrek gets them close to the exit and sets down Donkey and Fiona.\n\n\nSHREK\nOkay, you two, heard for the exit! I'll \ntake care of the dragon.\n\nShrek grabs a sword and heads back toward the interior of the \ncastle. He throws the sword down in between several overlapping \nchain links. The chain links are attached to the chandelier that \nis still around the dragons neck.\n\nSHREK\n(echoing) Run!\n\nThey all take off running for the exit with the dragon in hot \npursuit. They make it to the bridge and head across. The dragons \nbreathes fire and the bridge begins to burn. They all hang on \nfor dear life as the ropes holding the bridge up collapse. They \nare swung to the other side. As they hang upside down they look \nin horror as the dragon makes to fly over the boiling lava to \nget them. But suddenly the chandelier with the chain jerk the \ndragon back and she's unable to get to them. Our gang climbs \nquickly to safety as the dragon looks angry and then gives a \nsad whimper as she watches Donkey walk away.\n\nFIONA\n(sliding down the 'volcano' hill) You \ndid it! You rescued me! You're amazing. \n(behind her Donkey falls down the hill) \nYou're - - You're wonderful. You're... \n(turns and sees Shrek fall down the \nhill and bump into Donkey) a little \nunorthodox I'll admit. But thy deed \nis great, and thy heart is pure. I am \neternally in your debt. (Donkey clears \nhis throat.) And where would a brave \nknight be without his noble steed?\n\n\nDONKEY\nI hope you heard that. She called me \na noble steed. She think I'm a steed.\n\n\nFIONA\nThe battle is won. You may remove your \nhelmet, good Sir Knight.\n\nSHREK\nUh, no.\n\nFIONA\nWhy not?\n\nSHREK\nI have helmet hair.\n\nFIONA\nPlease. I would'st look upon the face \nof my rescuer.\n\nSHREK\nNo, no, you wouldn't - - 'st.\n\nFIONA\nBut how will you kiss me?\n\nSHREK\nWhat? (to Donkey) That wasn't in the \njob description.\n\nDONKEY\nMaybe it's a perk.\n\nFIONA\nNo, it's destiny. Oh, you must know \nhow it goes. A princess locked in a \ntower and beset by a dragon is rescued \nby a brave knight, and then they share \ntrue love's first kiss.\n\nDONKEY\nHmm? With Shrek? You think- - Wait. \nWait. You think that Shrek is you true \nlove?\n\nFIONA\nWell, yes.\n\nBoth Donkey and Shrek burst out laughing.\n\nDONKEY\nYou think Shrek is your true love!\n\n\nFIONA\nWhat is so funny?\n\nSHREK\nLet's just say I'm not your type, okay?Fiona: \nOf course, you are. You're my rescuer. \nNow - - Now remove your helmet.\n\nSHREK\nLook. I really don't think this is a \ngood idea.\n\nFIONA\nJust take off the helmet.\n\nSHREK\nI'm not going to.\n\nFIONA\nTake it off.\n\nSHREK\nNo!\n\nFIONA\nNow!\n\nSHREK\nOkay! Easy. As you command. Your Highness. \n(takes off his helmet)\n\nFIONA\nYou- - You're a- - an ogre.\n\nSHREK\nOh, you were expecting Prince Charming.\n\n\nFIONA\nWell, yes, actually. Oh, no. This is \nall wrong. You're not supposed to be \nan ogre.\n\nSHREK\nPrincess, I was sent to rescue you by \nLord Farquaad, okay? He is the one who \nwants to marry you.\n\nFIONA\nThen why didn't he come rescue me?\n\n\nSHREK\nGood question. You should ask him that \nwhen we get there.\n\nFIONA\nBut I have to be rescued by my true \nlove, not by some ogre and his- - his \npet.\n\nDONKEY\nWell, so much for noble steed.\n\nSHREK\nYou're not making my job any easier.\n\n\nFIONA\nI'm sorry, but your job is not my problem. \nYou can tell Lord Farquaad that if he \nwants to rescue me properly, I'll be \nwaiting for him right here.\n\nSHREK\nHey! I'm no one's messenger boy, all \nright? (ominous) I'm a delivery boy. \n(he swiftly picks her up and swings \nher over his shoulder like she was a \nsack of potatoes)\n\nFIONA\nYou wouldn't dare. Put me down!\n\nSHREK\nYa comin', Donkey?\n\nDONKEY\nI'm right behind ya.\n\nFIONA\nPut me down, or you will suffer the \nconsequences! This is not dignified! \nPut me down!\n\nWOODS\n\nA little time has passed and Fiona has calmed down. She just \nhangs there limply while Shrek carries her.\n\nDONKEY\nOkay, so here's another question. Say \nthere's a woman that digs you, right, \nbut you don't really like her that way. \nHow do you let her down real easy so \nher feelings aren't hurt, but you don't \nget burned to a crisp and eaten?\n\nFIONA\nYou just tell her she's not your true \nlove. Everyone knows what happens when \nyou find your...(Shrek drops her on \nthe ground) Hey! The sooner we get to \nDuLoc the better.\n\nDONKEY\nYou're gonna love it there, Princess. \nIt's beautiful!\n\nFIONA\nAnd what of my groom-to-be? Lord Farquaad? \nWhat's he like?\n\nSHREK\nLet me put it this way, Princess. Men \nof Farquaad's stature are in short supply. \n(he and Donkey laugh)\n\nShrek then proceeds to splash water onto his face to wash off \nthe dust and grime.\n\nDONKEY\nI don't know. There are those who think \nlittle of him. (they laugh again) Fiona: \nStop it. Stop it, both of you. You're \njust jealous you can never measure up \nto a great ruler like Lord Farquaad.\n\n\nSHREK\nYeah, well, maybe you're right, Princess. \nBut I'll let you do the \"measuring\" \nwhen you see him tomorrow.\n\nFIONA\n(looks at the setting sun) Tomorrow? \nIt'll take that long? Shouldn't we stop \nto make camp?\n\nSHREK\nNo, that'll take longer. We can keep \ngoing.\n\nFIONA\nBut there's robbers in the woods.\n\nDONKEY\nWhoa! Time out, Shrek! Camp is starting \nto sound good.\n\nSHREK\nHey, come on. I'm scarier than anything \nwe're going to see in this forest.\n\n\nFIONA\nI need to find somewhere to camp now!\n\n\nBoth Donkey and Shrek's ears lower as they shrink away from her.\n\n\nMOUNTAIN CLIFF\n\nShrek has found a cave that appears to be in good order. He shoves \na stone boulder out of the way to reveal the cave.\n\nSHREK\nHey! Over here.\n\nDONKEY\nShrek, we can do better than that. I \ndon't think this is fit for a princess.\n\n\nFIONA\nNo, no, it's perfect. It just needs \na few homey touches.\n\nSHREK\nHomey touches? Like what? (he hears \na tearing noise and looks over at Fiona \nwho has torn the bark off of a tree.)\n\n\nFIONA\nA door? Well, gentlemen, I bid thee \ngood night. (goes into the cave and \nputs the bark door up behind her)\n\n\nDONKEY\nYou want me to read you a bedtime story? \nI will.\n\nFIONA\n(os) I said good night!\n\nShrek looks at Donkey for a second and then goes to move the \nboulder back in front of the entrance to the cave with Fiona \nstill inside.\n\nDONKEY\nShrek, What are you doing?\n\nSHREK\n(laughs) I just- - You know - - Oh, \ncome on. I was just kidding.\n\nLATER THAT NIGHT\n\nShrek and Donkey are sitting around a campfire. They are staring \nup into the sky as Shrek points out certain star constellations \nto Donkey.\n\nSHREK\nAnd, uh, that one, that's Throwback, \nthe only ogre to ever spit over three \nwheat fields.\n\nDONKEY\nRight. Yeah. Hey, can you tell my future \nfrom these stars?\n\nSHREK\nThe stars don't tell the future, Donkey. \nThey tell stories. Look, there's Bloodnut, \nthe Flatulent. You can guess what he's \nfamous for.\n\nDONKEY\nI know you're making this up.\n\nSHREK\nNo, look. There he is, and there's the \ngroup of hunters running away from his \nstench.\n\nDONKEY\nThat ain't nothin' but a bunch of little \ndots.\n\nSHREK\nYou know, Donkey, sometimes things are \nmore than they appear. Hmm? Forget it.\n\n\nDONKEY\n(heaves a big sigh) Hey, Shrek, what \nwe gonna do when we get our swamp anyway?\n\n\nSHREK\nOur swamp?\n\nDONKEY\nYou know, when we're through rescuing \nthe princess.\n\nSHREK\nWe? Donkey, there's no \"we\". There's \nno \"our\". There's just me and my swamp. \nThe first thing I'm gonna do is build \na ten-foot wall around my land.\n\nDONKEY\nYou cut me deep, Shrek. You cut me real \ndeep just now. You know what I think? \nI think this whole wall thing is just \na way to keep somebody out.\n\nSHREK\nNo, do ya think?\n\nDONKEY\nAre you hidin' something?\n\nSHREK\nNever mind, Donkey.\n\nDONKEY\nOh, this is another one of those onion \nthings, isn't it?\n\nSHREK\nNo, this is one of those drop-it and \nleave-it alone things.\n\nDONKEY\nWhy don't you want to talk about it?\n\n\nSHREK\nWhy do you want to talk about it?\n\nDONKEY\nWhy are you blocking?\n\nSHREK\nI'm not blocking.\n\nDONKEY\nOh, yes, you are.\n\nSHREK\nDonkey, I'm warning you.\n\nDONKEY\nWho you trying to keep out?\n\nSHREK\nEveryone! Okay?\n\nDONKEY\n(pause) Oh, now we're gettin' somewhere. \n(grins)\n\nAt this point Fiona pulls the 'door' away from the entrance to \nthe cave and peaks out. Neither of the guys see her.\n\nSHREK\nOh! For the love of Pete! (gets up and \nwalks over to the edge of the cliff \nand sits down)\n\nDONKEY\nWhat's your problem? What you got against \nthe whole world anyway?\n\nSHREK\nLook, I'm not the one with the problem, \nokay? It's the world that seems to have \na problem with me. People take one look \nat me and go. \"Aah! Help! Run! A big, \nstupid, ugly ogre!\" They judge me before \nthey even know me. That's why I'm better \noff alone.\n\nDONKEY\nYou know what? When we met, I didn't \nthink you was just a big, stupid, ugly \nogre.\n\nSHREK\nYeah, I know.\n\nDONKEY\nSo, uh, are there any donkeys up there?\n\n\nSHREK\nWell, there's, um, Gabby, the Small \nand Annoying.\n\nDONKEY\nOkay, okay, I see it now. The big shiny \none, right there. That one there?\n\n\nFiona puts the door back.\n\nSHREK\nThat's the moon.\n\nDONKEY\nOh, okay.\n\nDuLoc - Farquaad's Bedroom\n\nThe camera pans over a lot of wedding stuff. Soft music plays \nin the background. Farquaad is in bed, watching as the Magic \nMirror shows him Princess Fiona.\n\nFARQUAAD\nAgain, show me again. Mirror, mirror, \nshow her to me. Show me the princess.\n\n\nMIRROR\nHmph.\n\nThe Mirror rewinds and begins to play again from the beginning.\n\n\nFARQUAAD\nAh. Perfect.\n\nFarquaad looks down at his bare chest and pulls the sheet up \nto cover himself as though Fiona could see him as he gazes sheepishly \nat her image in the mirror.\n\nMORNING\n\nFiona walks out of the cave. She glances at Shrek and Donkey \nwho are still sleeping. She wanders off into the woods and comes \nacross a blue bird. She begins to sing. The bird sings along \nwith her. She hits higher and higher notes and the bird struggles \nto keep up with her. Suddenly the pressure of the note is too \nbig and the bird explodes. Fiona looks a little sheepish, but \nshe eyes the eggs that the bird left behind. Time lapse, Fiona \nis now cooking the eggs for breakfast. Shrek and Donkey are still \nsleeping. Shrek wakes up and looks at Fiona. Donkey's talking \nin his sleep.\n\nDONKEY\n(quietly) Mmm, yeah, you know I like \nit like that. Come on, baby. I said \nI like it.\n\nSHREK\nDonkey, wake up. (shakes him)\n\nDONKEY\nHuh? What?\n\nSHREK\nWake up.\n\nDONKEY\nWhat? (stretches and yawns)\n\nFIONA\nGood morning. Hm, how do you like your \neggs?\n\nDONKEY\nOh, good morning, Princess!\n\nFiona gets up and sets the eggs down in front of them.\n\nSHREK\nWhat's all this about?\n\nFIONA\nYou know, we kind of got off to a bad \nstart yesterday. I wanted to make it \nup to you. I mean, after all, you did \nrescue me.\n\nSHREK\nUh, thanks.\n\nDonkey sniffs the eggs and licks his lips.\n\nFIONA\nWell, eat up. We've got a big day ahead \nof us. (walks off)\n\nLATER\n\nThey are once again on their way. They are walking through the \nforest. Shrek belches.\n\nDONKEY\nShrek!\n\nSHREK\nWhat? It's a compliment. Better out \nthan in, I always say. (laughs)\n\nDONKEY\nWell, it's no way to behave in front \nof a princess.\n\nFiona belches\n\nFIONA\nThanks.\n\nDONKEY\nShe's as nasty as you are.\n\nSHREK\n(chuckles) You know, you're not exactly \nwhat I expected.\n\nFIONA\nWell, maybe you shouldn't judge people \nbefore you get to know them.\n\nShe smiles and then continues walking, singing softly. Suddenly \nfrom out of nowhere, a man swings down and swoops Fiona up into \na tree.\n\nROBIN HOOD\nLa liberte! Hey!\n\nSHREK\nPrincess!\n\nFIONA\n(to Robin Hood) What are you doing?\n\n\nROBIN HOOD\nBe still, mon cherie, for I am you savior! \nAnd I am rescuing you from this green...(kisses \nup her arm while Fiona pulls back in \ndisgust)...beast.\n\nSHREK\nHey! That's my princess! Go find you \nown!\n\nROBIN HOOD\nPlease, monster! Can't you see I'm a \nlittle busy here?\n\nFIONA\n(getting fed up) Look, pal, I don't \nknow who you think you are!\n\nROBIN HOOD\nOh! Of course! Oh, how rude. Please \nlet me introduce myself. Oh, Merry Men. \n(laughs)\n\nSuddenly an accordion begins to play and the Merry men pop out \nfrom the bushes. They begin to sing Robin's theme song.\n\nMERRY MEN\nTa, dah, dah, dah, whoo.\n\nROBIN HOOD\nI steal from the rich and give to the \nneedy.\n\nMERRY MEN\nHe takes a wee percentage,\n\nROBIN HOOD\nBut I'm not greedy. I rescue pretty \ndamsels, man, I'm good.\n\nMERRY MEN\nWhat a guy, Monsieur Hood.\n\nROBIN HOOD\nBreak it down. I like an honest fight \nand a saucy little maid...\n\nMERRY MEN\nWhat he's basically saying is he likes \nto get...\n\nROBIN HOOD\nPaid. So...When an ogre in the bush \ngrabs a lady by the tush. That's bad.\n\n\nMERRY MEN\nThat's bad.\n\nROBIN HOOD\nWhen a beauty's with a beast it makes \nme awfully mad.\n\nMERRY MEN\nHe's mad, he's really, really mad.\n\n\nROBIN HOOD\nI'll take my blade and ram it through \nyour heart, keep your eyes on me, boys \n'cause I'm about to start...\n\nThere is a grunt as Fiona swings down from the tree limb and \nknocks Robin Hood unconscious.\n\nFIONA\nMan, that was annoying!\n\nShrek looks at her in admiration.\n\nMERRY MAN\nOh, you little- - (shoots an arrow at \nFiona but she ducks out of the way)\n\n\nThe arrow flies toward Donkey who jumps into Shrek's arms to \nget out of the way. The arrow proceeds to just bounce off a tree.\n\n\nAnother fight sequence begins and Fiona gives a karate yell and \nthen proceeds to beat the crap out of the Merry Men. There is \na very interesting 'Matrix' moment here when Fiona pauses in \nmid-air to fix her hair. Finally all of the Merry Men are down, \nand Fiona begins walking away.\n\nFIONA\nUh, shall we?\n\nSHREK\nHold the phone. (drops Donkey and begins \nwalking after Fiona) Oh! Whoa, whoa, \nwhoa. Hold on now. Where did that come \nfrom?\n\nFIONA\nWhat?\n\nSHREK\nThat! Back there. That was amazing! \nWhere did you learn that?\n\nFIONA\nWell...(laughs) when one lives alone, \nuh, one has to learn these things in \ncase there's a...(gasps and points) \nthere's an arrow in your butt!\n\nSHREK\nWhat? (turns and looks) Oh, would you \nlook at that? (he goes to pull it out \nbut flinches because it's tender)\n\n\nFIONA\nOh, no. This is all my fault. I'm so \nsorry.\n\nDONKEY\n(walking up) Why? What's wrong?\n\nFIONA\nShrek's hurt.\n\nDONKEY\nShrek's hurt. Shrek's hurt? Oh, no, \nShrek's gonna die.\n\nSHREK\nDonkey, I'm okay.\n\nDONKEY\nYou can't do this to me, Shrek. I'm \ntoo young for you to die. Keep you legs \nelevated. Turn your head and cough. \nDoes anyone know the Heimlich?\n\nFIONA\nDonkey! Calm down. If you want to help \nShrek, run into the woods and find me \na blue flower with red thorns.\n\nDONKEY\nBlue flower, red thorns. Okay, I'm on \nit. Blue flower, red thorns. Don't die \nShrek. If you see a long tunnel, stay \naway from the light!\n\nSHREK & FIONA\nDonkey!\n\nDONKEY\nOh, yeah. Right. Blue flower, red thorns. \n(runs off)\n\nSHREK\nWhat are the flowers for?\n\nFIONA\n(like it's obvious) For getting rid \nof Donkey.\n\nSHREK\nAh.\n\nFIONA\nNow you hold still, and I'll yank this \nthing out. (gives the arrow a little \npull)\n\nSHREK\n(jumps away) Ow! Hey! Easy with the \nyankin'.\n\nAs they continue to talk Fiona keeps going after the arrow and \nShrek keeps dodging her hands.\n\nFIONA\nI'm sorry, but it has to come out.\n\n\nSHREK\nNo, it's tender.\n\nFIONA\nNow, hold on.\n\nSHREK\nWhat you're doing is the opposite of \nhelp.\n\nFIONA\nDon't move.\n\nSHREK\nLook, time out.\n\nFIONA\nWould you...(grunts as Shrek puts his \nhand over her face to stop her from \ngetting at the arrow) Okay. What do \nyou propose we do?\n\nELSEWHERE\n\nDonkey is still looking for the special flower.\n\nDONKEY\nBlue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, \nred thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. \nThis would be so much easier if I wasn't \ncolor-blind! Blue flower, red thorns.\n\n\nSHREK\n(os) Ow!\n\nDONKEY\nHold on, Shrek! I'm comin'! (rips a \nflower off a nearby bush that just happens \nto be a blue flower with red thorns)\n\n\nTHE FOREST PATH\n\nSHREK\nOw! Not good.\n\nFIONA\nOkay. Okay. I can nearly see the head. \n(Shrek grunts as she pulls) It's just \nabout...\n\nSHREK\nOw! Ohh! (he jerks and manages to fall \nover with Fiona on top of him)\n\nDONKEY\nAhem.\n\nSHREK\n(throwing Fiona off of him) Nothing \nhappend. We were just, uh - -\n\nDONKEY\nLook, if you wanted to be alone, all \nyou had to do was ask. Okay?\n\nSHREK\nOh, come on! That's the last thing on \nmy mind. The princess here was just- \n- (Fiona pulls the arrow out) Ugh! (he \nturns to look at Fiona who holds up \nthe arrow with a smile) Ow!\n\nDONKEY\nHey, what's that? (nervous chuckle) \nThat's...is that blood?\n\nDonkey faints. Shrek walks over and picks him up as they continue \non their way.\n\nThere is a montage of scenes as the group heads back to DuLoc. \nShrek crawling up to the top of a tree to make it fall over a \nsmall brook so that Fiona won't get wet. Shrek then gets up as \nDonkey is just about to cross the tree and the tree swings back \ninto it's upright position and Donkey flies off. Shrek swatting \nand a bunch of flies and mosquitoes. Fiona grabs a nearby spiderweb \nthat's on a tree branch and runs through the field swinging it \naround to catch the bugs. She then hands it to Shrek who begins \neating like it's a treat. As he walks off she licks her fingers. \nShrek catching a toad and blowing it up like a balloon and presenting \nit to Fiona. Fiona catching a snake, blowing it up, fashioning \nit into a balloon animal and presenting it to Shrek. The group \narriving at a windmill that is near DuLoc.\n\nWINDMILL\n\nSHREK\nThere it is, Princess. Your future awaits \nyou.\n\nFIONA\nThat's DuLoc?\n\nDONKEY\nYeah, I know. You know, Shrek thinks \nLord Farquaad's compensating for something, \nwhich I think means he has a really...(Shrek \nsteps on his hoof) Ow!\n\nSHREK\nUm, I, uh- - I guess we better move \non.\n\nFIONA\nSure. But, Shrek? I'm - - I'm worried \nabout Donkey.\n\nSHREK\nWhat?\n\nFIONA\nI mean, look at him. He doesn't look \nso good.\n\nDONKEY\nWhat are you talking about? I'm fine.\n\n\nFIONA\n(kneels to look him in the eyes) That's \nwhat they always say, and then next \nthing you know, you're on your back. \n(pause) Dead.\n\nSHREK\nYou know, she's right. You look awful. \nDo you want to sit down?\n\nFIONA\nUh, you know, I'll make you some tea.\n\n\nDONKEY\nI didn't want to say nothin', but I \ngot this twinge in my neck, and when \nI turn my head like this, look, (turns \nhis neck in a very sharp way until his \nhead is completely sideways) Ow! See?\n\n\nSHREK\nWho's hungry? I'll find us some dinner.\n\n\nFIONA\nI'll get the firewood.\n\nDONKEY\nHey, where you goin'? Oh, man, I can't \nfeel my toes! (looks down and yelps) \nI don't have any toes! I think I need \na hug.\n\nSUNSET\n\nShrek has built a fire and is cooking the rest of dinner while \nFiona eats.\n\nFIONA\nMmm. This is good. This is really good. \nWhat is this?\n\nSHREK\nUh, weed rat. Rotisserie style.\n\nFIONA\nNo kidding. Well, this is delicious.\n\n\nSHREK\nWell, they're also great in stews. Now, \nI don't mean to brag, but I make a mean \nweed rat stew. (chuckles)\n\nFiona looks at DuLoc and sighs.\n\nFIONA\nI guess I'll be dining a little differently \ntomorrow night.\n\nSHREK\nMaybe you can come visit me in the swamp \nsometime. I'll cook all kind of stuff \nfor you. Swamp toad soup, fish eye tartare \n- - you name it.\n\nFIONA\n(smiles) I'd like that.\n\nThey smiles at each other.\n\nSHREK\nUm, Princess?\n\nFIONA\nYes, Shrek?\n\nSHREK\nI, um, I was wondering...are you...(sighs) \nAre you gonna eat that?\n\nDONKEY\n(chuckles) Man, isn't this romantic? \nJust look at that sunset.\n\nFIONA\n(jumps up) Sunset? Oh, no! I mean, it's \nlate. I-It's very late.\n\nSHREK\nWhat?\n\nDONKEY\nWait a minute. I see what's goin' on \nhere. You're afraid of the dark, aren't \nyou?\n\nFIONA\nYes! Yes, that's it. I'm terrified. \nYou know, I'd better go inside.\n\nDONKEY\nDon't feel bad, Princess. I used to \nbe afraid of the dark, too, until - \n- Hey, no, wait. I'm still afraid of \nthe dark.\n\nShrek sighs\n\nFIONA\nGood night.\n\nSHREK\nGood night.\n\nFiona goes inside the windmill and closes the door. Donkey looks \nat Shrek with a new eye.\n\nDONKEY\nOhh! Now I really see what's goin' on \nhere.\n\nSHREK\nOh, what are you talkin' about?\n\nDONKEY\nI don't even wanna hear it. Look, I'm \nan animal, and I got instincts. And \nI know you two were diggin' on each \nother. I could feel it.\n\nSHREK\nYou're crazy. I'm just bringing her \nback to Farquaad.\n\nDONKEY\nOh, come on, Shrek. Wake up and smell \nthe pheromones. Just go on in and tell \nher how you feel.\n\nSHREK\nI- - There's nothing to tell. Besides, \neven if I did tell her that, well, you \nknow - - and I'm not sayin' I do 'cause \nI don't - - she's a princess, and I'm \n- -\n\nDONKEY\nAn ogre?\n\nSHREK\nYeah. An ogre.\n\nDONKEY\nHey, where you goin'?\n\nSHREK\nTo get... move firewood. (sighs)\n\nDonkey looks over at the large pile of firewood there already \nis.\n\nTIME LAPSE\n\nDonkey opens the door to the Windmill and walks in. Fiona is \nnowhere to be seen.\n\nDONKEY\nPrincess? Princess Fiona? Princess, \nwhere are you? Princess?\n\nFiona looks at Donkey from the shadows, but we can't see her.\n\n\nDONKEY\nIt's very spooky in here. I ain't playing \nno games.\n\nSuddenly Fiona falls from the railing. She gets up only she doesn't \nlook like herself. She looks like an ogre and Donkey starts freaking \nout.\n\nDONKEY\nAah!\n\nFIONA\nOh, no!\n\nDONKEY\nNo, help!\n\nFIONA\nShh!\n\nDONKEY\nShrek! Shrek! Shrek!\n\nFIONA\nNo, it's okay. It's okay.\n\nDONKEY\nWhat did you do with the princess?\n\n\nFIONA\nDonkey, I'm the princess.\n\nDONKEY\nAah!\n\nFIONA\nIt's me, in this body.\n\nDONKEY\nOh, my God! You ate the princess. (to \nher stomach) Can you hear me?\n\nFIONA\nDonkey!\n\nDONKEY\n(still aimed at her stomach) Listen, \nkeep breathing! I'll get you out of \nthere!\n\nFIONA\nNo!\n\nDONKEY\nShrek! Shrek! Shrek!\n\nFIONA\nShh.\n\nDONKEY\nShrek!\n\nFIONA\nThis is me.\n\nDonkey looks into her eyes as she pets his muzzle, and he quiets \ndown.\n\nDONKEY\nPrincess? What happened to you? You're, \nuh, uh, uh, different.\n\nFIONA\nI'm ugly, okay?\n\nDONKEY\nWell, yeah! Was it something you ate? \n'Cause I told Shrek those rats was a \nbad idea. You are what you eat, I said. \nNow - -\n\nFIONA\nNo. I - - I've been this way as long \nas I can remember.\n\nDONKEY\nWhat do you mean? Look, I ain't never \nseen you like this before.\n\nFIONA\nIt only happens when sun goes down. \n\"By night one way, by day another. This \nshall be the norm... until you find \ntrue love's first kiss... and then take \nlove's true form.\"\n\nDONKEY\nAh, that's beautiful. I didn't know \nyou wrote poetry.\n\nFIONA\nIt's a spell. (sigh) When I was a little \ngirl, a witch cast a spell on me. Every \nnight I become this. This horrible, \nugly beast! I was placed in a tower \nto await the day my true love would \nrescue me. That's why I have to marry \nLord Farquaad tomorrow before the sun \nsets and he sees me like this. (begins \nto cry)\n\nDONKEY\nAll right, all right. Calm down. Look, \nit's not that bad. You're not that ugly. \nWell, I ain't gonna lie. You are ugly. \nBut you only look like this at night. \nShrek's ugly 24-7.\n\nFIONA\nBut Donkey, I'm a princess, and this \nis not how a princess is meant to look.\n\n\nDONKEY\nPrincess, how 'bout if you don't marry \nFarquaad?\n\nFIONA\nI have to. Only my true love's kiss \ncan break the spell.\n\nDONKEY\nBut, you know, um, you're kind of an \norge, and Shrek - - well, you got a \nlot in common.\n\nFIONA\nShrek?\n\nOUTSIDE\n\nShrek is walking towards the windmill with a sunflower in his \nhand.\n\nSHREK\n(to himself) Princess, I - - Uh, how's \nit going, first of all? Good? Um, good \nfor me too. I'm okay. I saw this flower \nand thought of you because it's pretty \nand - - well, I don't really like it, \nbut I thought you might like it 'cause \nyou're pretty. But I like you anyway. \nI'd - - uh, uh...(sighs) I'm in trouble. \nOkay, here we go.\n\nHe walks up to the door and pauses outside when he hears Donkey \nand Fiona talking.\n\nFIONA\n(os) I can't just marry whoever I want. \nTake a good look at me, Donkey. I mean, \nreally, who can ever love a beast so \nhideous and ugly? \"Princess\" and \"ugly\" \ndon't go together. That's why I can't \nstay here with Shrek.\n\nShrek steps back in shock.\n\nFIONA\n(os) My only chance to live happily \never after is to marry my true love.\n\n\nShrek heaves a deep sigh. He throws the flower down and walks \naway.\n\nINSIDE\n\nFIONA\nDon't you see, Donkey? That's just how \nit has to be. It's the only way to break \nthe spell.\n\nDONKEY\nYou at least gotta tell Shrek the truth.\n\n\nFIONA\nNo! You can't breathe a word. No one \nmust ever know.\n\nDONKEY\nWhat's the point of being able to talk \nif you gotta keep secrets?\n\nFIONA\nPromise you won't tell. Promise!\n\nDONKEY\nAll right, all right. I won't tell him. \nBut you should. (goes outside) I just \nknow before this is over, I'm gonna \nneed a whole lot of serious therapy. \nLook at my eye twitchin'.\n\nFiona comes out the door and watches him walk away. She looks \ndown and spots the sunflower. She picks it up before going back \ninside the windmill.\n\nMORNING\n\nDonkey is asleep. Shrek is nowhere to be seen. Fiona is still \nawake. She is plucking petals from the sunflower.\n\nFIONA\nI tell him, I tell him not. I tell him, \nI tell him not. I tell him. (she quickly \nruns to the door and goes outside) Shrek! \nShrek, there's something I want...(she \nlooks and sees the rising sun, and as \nthe sun crests the sky she turns back \ninto a human.)\n\nJust as she looks back at the sun she sees Shrek stomping towards \nher.\n\nFIONA\nShrek. Are you all right?\n\nSHREK\nPerfect! Never been better.\n\nFIONA\nI - - I don't - - There's something \nI have to tell you.\n\nSHREK\nYou don't have to tell me anything, \nPrincess. I heard enough last night.\n\n\nFIONA\nYou heard what I said?\n\nSHREK\nEvery word.\n\nFIONA\nI thought you'd understand.\n\nSHREK\nOh, I understand. Like you said, \"Who \ncould love a hideous, ugly beast?\"\n\n\nFIONA\nBut I thought that wouldn't matter to \nyou.\n\nSHREK\nYeah? Well, it does. (Fiona looks at \nhim in shock. He looks past her and \nspots a group approaching.) Ah, right \non time. Princess, I've brought you \na little something.\n\nFarquaad has arrived with a group of his men. He looks very regal \nsitting up on his horse. You would never guess that he's only \nlike 3 feet tall. Donkey wakes up with a yawn as the soldiers \nmarch by.\n\nDONKEY\nWhat'd I miss? What'd I miss? (spots \nthe soldiers) (muffled) Who said that? \nCouldn't have been the donkey.\n\nFARQUAAD\nPrincess Fiona.\n\nSHREK\nAs promised. Now hand it over.\n\nFARQUAAD\nVery well, ogre. (holds out a piece \nof paper) The deed to your swamp, cleared \nout, as agreed. Take it and go before \nI change my mind. (Shrek takes the paper) \nForgive me, Princess, for startling \nyou, but you startled me, for I have \nnever seen such a radiant beauty before. \nI'm Lord Farquaad.\n\nFIONA\nLord Farquaad? Oh, no, no. (Farquaad \nsnaps his fingers) Forgive me, my lord, \nfor I was just saying a short... (Watches \nas Farquaad is lifted off his horse \nand set down in front of her. He comes \nto her waist.) farewell.\n\nFARQUAAD\nOh, that is so sweet. You don't have \nto waste good manners on the ogre. It's \nnot like it has feelings.\n\nFIONA\nNo, you're right. It doesn't.\n\nDonkey watches this exchange with a curious look on his face.\n\n\nFARQUAAD\nPrincess Fiona, beautiful, fair, flawless \nFiona. I ask your hand in marriage. \nWill you be the perfect bride for the \nperfect groom?\n\nFIONA\nLord Farquaad, I accept. Nothing would \nmake - -\n\nFARQUAAD\n(interrupting) Excellent! I'll start \nthe plans, for tomorrow we wed!\n\nFIONA\nNo! I mean, uh, why wait? Let's get \nmarried today before the sun sets.\n\n\nFARQUAAD\nOh, anxious, are you? You're right. \nThe sooner, the better. There's so much \nto do! There's the caterer, the cake, \nthe band, the guest list. Captain, round \nup some guests! (a guard puts Fiona \non the back of his horse)\n\nFIONA\nFare-thee-well, ogre.\n\nFarquaad's whole party begins to head back to DuLoc. Donkey watches \nthem go.\n\nDONKEY\nShrek, what are you doing? You're letting \nher get away.\n\nSHREK\nYeah? So what?\n\nDONKEY\nShrek, there's something about her you \ndon't know. Look, I talked to her last \nnight, She's - -\n\nSHREK\nI know you talked to her last night. \nYou're great pals, aren't ya? Now, if \nyou two are such good friends, why don't \nyou follow her home?\n\nDONKEY\nShrek, I - - I wanna go with you.\n\nSHREK\nI told you, didn't I? You're not coming \nhome with me. I live alone! My swamp! \nMe! Nobody else! Understand? Nobody! \nEspecially useless, pathetic, annoying, \ntalking donkeys!\n\nDONKEY\nBut I thought - -\n\nSHREK\nYeah. You know what? You thought wrong! \n(stomps off)\n\nDONKEY\nShrek.\n\nMontage of different scenes. Shrek arriving back home. Fiona \nbeing fitted for the wedding dress. Donkey at a stream running \ninto the dragon. Shrek cleaning up his house. Fiona eating dinner \nalone. Shrek eating dinner alone.\n\nSHREK'S HOME\n\nShrek is eating dinner when he hears a sound outside. He goes \noutside to investigate.\n\nSHREK\nDonkey? (Donkey ignores him and continues \nwith what he's doing.) What are you \ndoing?\n\nDONKEY\nI would think, of all people, you would \nrecognize a wall when you see one.\n\n\nSHREK\nWell, yeah. But the wall's supposed \nto go around my swamp, not through it.\n\n\nDONKEY\nIt is around your half. See that's your \nhalf, and this is my half.\n\nSHREK\nOh! Your half. Hmm.\n\nDONKEY\nYes, my half. I helped rescue the princess. \nI did half the work. I get half the \nbooty. Now hand me that big old rock, \nthe one that looks like your head.\n\n\nSHREK\nBack off!\n\nDONKEY\nNo, you back off.\n\nSHREK\nThis is my swamp!\n\nDONKEY\nOur swamp.\n\nSHREK\n(grabs the tree branch Donkey is working \nwith) Let go, Donkey!\n\nDONKEY\nYou let go.\n\nSHREK\nStubborn jackass!\n\nDONKEY\nSmelly ogre.\n\nSHREK\nFine! (drops the tree branch and walks \naway)\n\nDONKEY\nHey, hey, come back here. I'm not through \nwith you yet.\n\nSHREK\nWell, I'm through with you.\n\nDONKEY\nUh-uh. You know, with you it's always, \n\"Me, me, me!\" Well, guess what! Now \nit's my turn! So you just shut up and \npay attention! You are mean to me. You \ninsult me and you don't appreciate anything \nthat I do! You're always pushing me \naround or pushing me away.\n\nSHREK\nOh, yeah? Well, if I treated you so \nbad, how come you came back?\n\nDONKEY\nBecause that's what friends do! They \nforgive each other!\n\nSHREK\nOh, yeah. You're right, Donkey. I forgive \nyou... for stabbin' me in the back! \n(goes into the outhouse and slams the \ndoor)\n\nDONKEY\nOhh! You're so wrapped up in layers, \nonion boy, you're afraid of your own \nfeelings.\n\nSHREK\n(os) Go away!\n\nDONKEY\nThere you are , doing it again just \nlike you did to Fiona. All she ever \ndo was like you, maybe even love you.\n\n\nSHREK\n(os) Love me? She said I was ugly, a \nhideous creature. I heard the two of \nyou talking.\n\nDONKEY\nShe wasn't talkin' about you. She was \ntalkin' about, uh, somebody else.\n\n\nSHREK\n(opens the door and comes out) She wasn't \ntalking about me? Well, then who was \nshe talking about?\n\nDONKEY\nUh-uh, no way. I ain't saying anything. \nYou don't wanna listen to me. Right? \nRight?\n\nSHREK\nDonkey!\n\nDONKEY\nNo!\n\nSHREK\nOkay, look. I'm sorry, all right? (sigh) \nI'm sorry. I guess I am just a big, \nstupid, ugly ogre. Can you forgive me?\n\n\nDONKEY\nHey, that's what friends are for, right?\n\n\nSHREK\nRight. Friends?\n\nDONKEY\nFriends.\n\nSHREK\nSo, um, what did Fiona say about me?\n\n\nDONKEY\nWhat are you asking me for? Why don't \nyou just go ask her?\n\nSHREK\nThe wedding! We'll never make it in \ntime.\n\nDONKEY\nHa-ha-ha! Never fear, for where, there's \na will, there's a way and I have a way. \n(whistles)\n\nSuddenly the dragon arrives overhead and flies low enough so \nthey can climb on.\n\nSHREK\nDonkey?\n\nDONKEY\nI guess it's just my animal magnetism.\n\n\nThey both laugh.\n\nSHREK\nAw, come here, you. (gives Donkey a \nnoogie)\n\nDONKEY\nAll right, all right. Don't get all \nslobbery. No one likes a kiss ass. All \nright, hop on and hold on tight. I haven't \nhad a chance to install the seat belts \nyet.\n\nThey climb aboard the dragon and she takes off for DuLoc.\n\nDULOC - CHURCH\n\nFiona and Farquaad are getting married. The whole town is there. \nThe prompter card guy holds up a card that says 'Revered Silence'.\n\n\nPRIEST\nPeople of DuLoc, we gather here today \nto bear witness to the union....\n\nFIONA\n(eyeing the setting sun) Um-\n\nPRIEST\n...of our new king...\n\nFIONA\nExcuse me. Could we just skip ahead \nto the \"I do's\"?\n\nFARQUAAD\n(chuckles and then motions to the priest \nto indulge Fiona) Go on.\n\nCOURTYARD\n\nSome guards are milling around. Suddenly the dragon lands with \na boom. The guards all take off running.\n\nDONKEY\n(to Dragon) Go ahead, HAVE SOME FUN. \nIf we need you, I'll whistle. How about \nthat? (she nods and goes after the guards) \nShrek, wait, wait! Wait a minute! You \nwanna do this right, don't you?\n\nSHREK\n(at the Church door) What are you talking \nabout?\n\nDONKEY\nThere's a line you gotta wait for. The \npreacher's gonna say, \"Speak now or \nforever hold your peace.\" That's when \nyou say, \"I object!\"\n\nSHREK\nI don't have time for this!\n\nDONKEY\nHey, wait. What are you doing? Listen \nto me! Look, you love this woman, don't \nyou?\n\nSHREK\nYes.\n\nDONKEY\nYou wanna hold her?\n\nSHREK\nYes.\n\nDONKEY\nPlease her?\n\nSHREK\nYes!\n\nDONKEY\n(singing James Brown style) Then you \ngot to, got to try a little tenderness. \n(normal) The chicks love that romantic \ncrap!\n\nSHREK\nAll right! Cut it out. When does this \nguy say the line?\n\nDONKEY\nWe gotta check it out.\n\nINSIDE CHURCH\n\nAs the priest talks we see Donkey's shadow through one of the \nwindows Shrek tosses him up so he can see.\n\nPRIEST\nAnd so, by the power vested in me...\n\n\nOutside\n\nSHREK\nWhat do you see?\n\nDONKEY\nThe whole town's in there.\n\nInside\n\nPRIEST\nI now pronounce you husband and wife...\n\n\nOutside\n\nDONKEY\nThey're at the altar.\n\nInside\n\nPRIEST\n...king and queen.\n\nOutside\n\nDONKEY\nMother Fletcher! He already said it.\n\n\nSHREK\nOh, for the love of Pete!\n\nHe runs inside without catching Donkey, who hits the ground hard.\n\n\nINSIDE CHURCH\n\nSHREK\n(running toward the alter) I object!\n\n\nFIONA\nShrek?\n\nThe whole congregation gasps as they see Shrek.\n\nFARQUAAD\nOh, now what does he want?\n\nSHREK\n(to congregation as he reaches the front \nof the Church) Hi, everyone. Havin' \na good time, are ya? I love DuLoc, first \nof all. Very clean.\n\nFIONA\nWhat are you doing here?\n\nSHREK\nReally, it's rude enough being alive \nwhen no one wants you, but showing up \nuninvited to a wedding...\n\nSHREK\nFiona! I need to talk to you.\n\nFIONA\nOh, now you wanna talk? It's a little \nlate for that, so if you'll excuse me \n- -\n\nSHREK\nBut you can't marry him.\n\nFIONA\nAnd why not?\n\nSHREK\nBecause- - Because he's just marring \nyou so he can be king.\n\nFARQUAAD\nOutrageous! Fiona, don't listen to him.\n\n\nSHREK\nHe's not your true love.\n\nFIONA\nAnd what do you know about true love?\n\n\nSHREK\nWell, I - - Uh - - I mean - -\n\nFARQUAAD\nOh, this is precious. The ogee has fallen \nin love with the princess! Oh, good \nLord. (laughs)\n\nThe prompter card guy holds up a card that says 'Laugh'. The \nwhole congregation laughs.\n\nFARQUAAD\nAn ogre and a princess!\n\nFIONA\nShrek, is this true?\n\nFARQUAAD\nWho cares? It's preposterous! Fiona, \nmy love, we're but a kiss away from \nour \"happily ever after.\" Now kiss me! \n(puckers his lips and leans toward her, \nbut she pulls back.)\n\nFIONA\n(looking at the setting sun) \"By night \none way, by day another.\" (to Shrek) \nI wanted to show you before.\n\nShe backs up and as the sun sets she changes into her ogre self. \nShe gives Shrek a sheepish smile.\n\nSHREK\nWell, uh, that explains a lot. (Fiona \nsmiles)\n\nFARQUAAD\nUgh! It's disgusting! Guards! Guards! \nI order you to get that out of my sight \nnow! Get them! Get them both!\n\nThe guards run in and separate Fiona and Shrek. Shrek fights \nthem.\n\nSHREK\nNo, no!\n\nFIONA\nShrek!\n\nFARQUAAD\nThis hocus-pocus alters nothing. This \nmarriage is binding, and that makes \nme king! See? See?\n\nFIONA\nNo, let go of me! Shrek!\n\nSHREK\nNo!\n\nFARQUAAD\nDon't just stand there, you morons.\n\n\nSHREK\nGet out of my way! Fiona! Arrgh!\n\nFARQUAAD\nI'll make you regret the day we met. \nI'll see you drawn and quartered! You'll \nbeg for death to save you!\n\nFIONA\nNo, Shrek!\n\nFARQUAAD\n(hold a dagger to Fiona's throat) And \nas for you, my wife...\n\nSHREK\nFiona!\n\nFARQUAAD\nI'll have you locked back in that tower \nfor the rest of your days! I'm king!\n\n\nShrek manages to get a hand free and he whistles.\n\nFARQUAAD\nI will have order! I will have perfection! \nI will have - - (Donkey and the dragon \nshow up and the dragon leans down and \neats Farquaad) Aaaah! Aah!\n\nDONKEY\nAll right. Nobody move. I got a dragon \nhere, and I'm not afraid to use it. \n(The dragon roars.) I'm a donkey on \nthe edge!\n\nThe dragon belches and Farquaad's crown flies out of her mouth \nand falls to the ground.\n\nDONKEY\nCelebrity marriages. They never last, \ndo they?\n\nThe congregation cheers.\n\nDONKEY\nGo ahead, Shrek.\n\nSHREK\nUh, Fiona?\n\nFIONA\nYes, Shrek?\n\nSHREK\nI - - I love you.\n\nFIONA\nReally?\n\nSHREK\nReally, really.\n\nFIONA\n(smiles) I love you too.\n\nShrek and Fiona kiss. Thelonius takes one of the cards and writes \n'Awwww' on the back and then shows it to the congregation.\n\n\nCONGREGATION\nAawww!\n\nSuddenly the magic of the spell pulls Fiona away. She's lifted \nup into the air and she hovers there while the magic works around \nher.\n\nWHISPERS\n\"Until you find true love's first kiss \nand then take love's true form. Take \nlove's true form. Take love's true form.\"\n\n\nSuddenly Fiona's eyes open wide. She's consumed by the spell \nand then is slowly lowered to the ground.\n\nSHREK\n(going over to her) Fiona? Fiona. Are \nyou all right?\n\nFIONA\n(standing up, she's still an ogre) Well, \nyes. But I don't understand. I'm supposed \nto be beautiful.\n\nSHREK\nBut you ARE beautiful.\n\nThey smile at each other.\n\nDONKEY\n(chuckles) I was hoping this would be \na happy ending.\n\nShrek and Fiona kiss...and the kiss fades into...\n\nTHE SWAMP\n\n...their wedding kiss. Shrek and Fiona are now married. 'I'm \na Believer' by Smashmouth is played in the background. Shrek \nand Fiona break apart and run through the crowd to their awaiting \ncarriage. Which is made of a giant onion. Fiona tosses her bouquet \nwhich both Cinderella and Snow White try to catch. But they end \nup getting into a cat fight and so the dragon catches the bouquet \ninstead. The Gingerbread man has been mended somewhat and now \nhas one leg and walks with a candy cane cane. Shrek and Fiona \nwalk off as the rest of the guests party and Donkey takes over \nsinging the song.\n\nGINGERBREAD MAN\nGod bless us, every one.\n\nDONKEY\n(as he's done singing and we fade to \nblack) Oh, that's funny. Oh. Oh. I can't \nbreathe. I can't breathe.",
